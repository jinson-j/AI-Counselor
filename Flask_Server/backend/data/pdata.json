Students who maintain the required minimum grade point average of 2.00 are considered to be in good standing with the university and are eligible for continued enrollment at Virginia Tech. Students on academic probation and warning are eligible for continued enrollment and good standing (absent any violations of policies outlined in the Hokie Handbook. Academic Warning: Students earning less than a 2.00 term GPA, but with a cumulative grade point average of 2.00 or higher, will be placed on academic warning without notation on the academic transcript. Students on academic warning will be required to consult with the appropriate undergraduate assistant or associate dean of their college and to sign an academic contract. Failure to complete an action plan (academic contract) may result in prohibition from future enrollment(s). Academic probation is imposed when a student's cumulative GPA is less than 2.00; academic probation is lifted when their cumulative GPA is at least 2.00. Academic performance will be reviewed at the end of each regular semester (fall and spring). A student on probation: 1. may take no more than 16 credits per semester; 2. 2. may be required (at the discretion of individual colleges) to consult with an academic advisor regularly and to sign an academic contract acknowledging their performance is not meeting university standards and stating what actions they are committed to taking to improve academic performance. First suspension will be imposed whenever one of the following occurs: 1. A student on academic probation has a cumulative GPA less than 2.00 for the first two semesters (fall, spring) of enrollment; or 2. A student has two consecutive semesters thereafter with a cumulative GPA below 2.00. First Suspension (Fall): A student who is placed on first academic suspension at the end of fall semester will be suspended from continued enrollment through the end of the following spring semester. Note: Students placed on first academic suspension at the end of fall semester are eligible to return the subsequent first summer, second summer, or fall semester. First Suspension (Spring): A student who is placed on first academic suspension at the end of spring semester will be suspended from continued enrollment through the end of the following fall semester. Note: Students placed on first academic suspension at the end of spring semester may NOT enroll in the immediately following summer sessions. A student must earn a minimum 2.00 semester GPA the first semester back and raise their cumulative GPA to at least 2.00 by the end of the second semester back or earn a 2.50 GPA for every semester following the suspension until their cumulative GPA is 2.00 or greater. A student will be placed on second academic suspension for failure to meet these minimum performance requirements upon their return. Second Suspension (Fall): A student who is placed on second academic suspension at the end of fall semester will be suspended from continued enrollment through the end of the following fall semester. Note: Students placed on second academic suspension at the end of fall semester may NOT enroll in the immediately following summer sessions. Second Suspension (Spring): A student who is placed on second academic suspension at the end of spring semester will be suspended from continued enrollment through the end of the following spring semester. Note: Students placed on second academic suspension at the end of spring semester may NOT enroll in the immediately following summer sessions. The same minimum returning performance requirements apply for second suspension as for first suspension. Final Suspension: A student will be permanently dismissed for failure to meet the minimum returning performance requirements after a second academic suspension.Academic Eligibility Appeals Students who are suspended due to academic eligibility at the end of fall or spring terms may appeal their suspension to the University Appeals Committee. The University Appeals Committee is comprised of the associate deans of undergraduate studies of the academic colleges and one faculty member appointed by the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Academic Affairs. A representative of the Dean of Students Office participates as a non-voting member of the committee to provide any information and background available through their advocacy services. The University Appeals Committee is an advisory committee to the Vice Provost for Undergraduate Academic Affairs. Any appeal for exceptions to the academic eligibility requirements must be based on clear extenuating circumstances beyond a student's control that negatively impacted academic performance. If an appeal is based on physical, psychiatric, or disability/learning disability reasons, the appeal must be reviewed by the Health Evaluating Committee. A recommendation letter from the appropriate office is required to complete an appeal petition. Students must complete an academic appeals petition and submit all required documentation to the associate dean of their major college by the published college deadline. Failure to meet the published deadline results in the loss of opportunity to appeal for the term. Students have a right to appear in person at the appeals meeting. Students may not bring an outside advocate to an appeals meeting. Full instructions and forms for academic appeals are available on each academic college website along with the dates of the academic appeals meetings. The associate dean of the student's major college may require a preliminary meeting to discuss the appeal. The associate dean also may establish an independent submission deadline prior to each University Appeals committee meeting. If the University Appeals Committee denies an appeal, the student may request further consideration of the academic appeal by the provost's representative. The decision of the provost's representative is final and there is no further recourse.

Virginia Tech Southern Dr. University University Association of 2010 - Yes Kenneth accreditation accreditation Colleges and 2019 Smith Schools (SACS) Applying for Your Degree All students must apply for a degree during the first semester of their junior year. The application for degree can be found on Hokie SPA under the Degree Menu. Once students have completed the application, they should generate a Degree Audit Report (DARS). The DARS report will help students to be fully aware of all degree requirements, which remain to be completed. This report can also be generated through Hokie SPA. Double Major(s): Undergraduate students who fulfill the requirements for two majors concurrently will receive recognition of the second major (double major) by including the additional major on their application for degree on Hokie Spa. Only the primary major will appear on the diploma. Students will receive double major certificates in recognition of the second major. The additional major will be included on students' official transcripts. Second Undergraduate Degree: Students may earn a second bachelor's degree (and diploma) by earning a minimum of 30 additional credit hours in residence with a minimum 2.00 GPA on all work attempted. All specific requirements must be met for each degree program, including attainment of the 2.00 GPA for all courses in the major. Note: The threshold for the total number of pass/fail hours allowed may not exceed the maximum for the first degree. Traditionally, degrees are conferred upon candidates who are present to receive them at the Commencement ceremony in May. Candidates may have their degrees conferred in absentia if they cannot be present at Commencement. To arrange for this, a candidate must indicate to the University Registrar either via Hokie SPA or in writing to be excused from the Commencement ceremony. In addition to the traditional Commencement, other \"Degree Conferral Dates\" have been established for each May to May year. The degree conferral dates for fall, winter, first summer, and second summer appear on the diplomas of qualified graduates. The degree conferral dates fall on the last day of final examinations (last day of term) for first summer session, second summer session, fall semester, and winter term. Names of graduates of summer and fall terms will appear in the fall commencement ceremony program only. No commencement ceremonies are conducted at the end of the summer sessions, but graduates may attend the fall ceremony after completion of degree requirements. They may also request permission from thedepartment to \"walk through\" the spring commencement ceremony based on established departmental or college guidelines. Diplomas are not distributed. Completion of degree requirements is determined after the final grade reports are available. Degrees are regarded as having been conferred on the appropriate conferral date upon determination by the University Registrar that degree requirements have been met. All course enrollments and attendance obligations must have been completed on or before the degree conferral date. University actions, such as Honor System or Conduct System sanctions, may delay the awarding of a degree, the effective term of the degree and release of the diploma. Students with university actions will have their final degree conferral date moved in accordance with the completion of sanctions. Students who are unable to complete degree requirements based on their original application for degree term are responsible for moving their date of completion. Students may resolve degree completion problems up to thirty (30) days after the degree term to retain the conferral date on the diploma. Any resolutions of degree completion problems following the thirty day resolution window will be conferred on the next subsequent term following resolution of the problem(s). Resolutions of degree problems include failure to submit appropriate paperwork to the university. With the exception of spring, diplomas for all other \"Degree Conferral Dates\" are ordered after course work completions are established. Diplomas are distributed either by mail or in person to graduates who appear in the Office of the University Registrar, or at the next Commencement ceremony, if available. Assessment of Student Learning Experiences A critical element in the continuous improvement of programs and services at Virginia Tech is the evaluation of student learning experiences, perceptions, and academic achievement. Each student may be asked to participate in assessment activities, including but not limited to course assignments, surveys, focus groups, end of course evaluations, tests, and personal interviews. Student involvement in these assessment activities will assist Virginia Tech in providing current and future students with high-quality learning experiences in keeping with the mission of the University. Combination Degrees The bachelor's degree will be awarded to a student who has satisfactorily completed three years of undergraduate work in an appropriate curriculum and the first year of work in an accredited medical, dental, veterinary, or law school, or medical technology program (biology majors only), or physical therapy program (biology majors only), provided the student fulfills the requirements for the three-year program as follows: At least two of the three years of pre-professional work, including the third year in residence, must be at the university. A minimum of 90 semester hours undergraduate work, i.e. pre-professional school credit, must be earned. Curriculum for Liberal Education requirements must be met, plus at least 18 of the 30 hours required in the major during the three-year, pre-professional work program. A department may require more than 18 hours of course work in the major. Degree Programs Virginia Tech offers four-year degree programs leading to a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, or Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. Also offered are five-year Bachelor of Architecture and Bachelor of Landscape Architecture programs. Virginia Tech also offers graduate work in 76 fields of study leading to masters degrees and in 62 fields leading to doctoral degrees. A professional degree is offered through the Virginia- Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, located at Virginia Tech, and a medical degree from the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine. Directed and Independent EnrollmentVirginia Tech offers several types of courses that can be tailored to the needs of individual students or special groups. By allowing students to pursue topics in which formal courses are not available, these directed and independent courses provide greater flexibility in course offerings. They also provide students an opportunity to assume a greater share of the responsibility for their own education outside the traditional classroom situation. In order to enroll in a directed or independent course, students must develop a plan of work to reach particular objectives, obtain approval of both the department and the faculty member who will supervise the work, and work with them to arrange hours and credits. Students must submit an official approval form prior to registration. In most cases, the student's first contact for an independent study, field study, or undergraduate research course is the department offering the course. Registration is through the student's dean's office. Special study courses are set up by the department, and the student registers through web course request. Some colleges and departments have restrictions on eligibility to register for these courses, and limit the number of hours that can be used toward graduation. Field Study (X964) courses are work experiences approved by some departments and are selected to augment traditional classroom activities. The student is evaluated on the knowledge and skills acquired as a result of the experience. Emphasis is placed on the academic and practical value of the work. Independent Study (X974) courses generally involve extensive reading and tutorial sessions with the faculty supervisor and also may involve written papers and other assessments. The subject of Independent Study usually is a continuation in greater depth of a topic covered in a regular course, allowing students to study topics of particular individual interest. Special Study (X984) courses are designed for a group of students, rather than for a single individual. This type of course may be used to study a timely topic, one in which there is current, but not necessarily lasting, interest. It also may be used to launch an experimental course before incorporating it into the regular curriculum. Undergraduate Research (X994) courses are individual research projects carried out by students under faculty supervision. The student defines the research topic, proposes a methodology, carries out the research, and writes a report. Global Education Virginia Tech students have the opportunity to study abroad through various programs spanning the globe. Study abroad programs touch on almost every academic discipline and provide the opportunity to develop or strengthen global competency. Students can experience an academic discipline at work in an international setting, improve language skills, cultivate new intellectual interests, challenge assumptions about their own and foreign cultures, and build intercultural networks, understanding, and communication skills of value to future employers.. The Steger Center for International Scholarship, located in the picturesque town of Riva San Vitale, Switzerland, is Virginia Tech's study center in Europe. Housed in a 250-year-old villa, the Steger Center provides classrooms, a library, an architecture studio, study and lounge areas, a cafeteria, and a garden in an unforgettable setting. The central location allows for excursions to other European sites that complement classroom instruction. Steger Center programs offer courses in architecture, geosciences, the humanities, University Honors, and Italian that may count toward Curriculum for Liberal Education and major requirements. Students may participate in semester-long programs in the fall and spring or short-term programs in the summer. Virginia Tech also has a growing number of study abroad opportunities in Africa. Growing more rapidly than any other part of the world and representing the next great frontier for innovations in business, science, and technology, Africa is a critical region for the world's future. The opportunity to live and study shoulder-to- shoulder with Africa's youth as they rise to meet the extraordinary challenges of their future offers VT studentsa unique pathway to academic, personal, social, and professional growth. Faculty-led programs on every continent provide another option for international experience. Virginia Tech faculty design and lead more than 70 short-term courses abroad during the winter or summer terms. Participants in faculty-led programs have the ability to focus on a specific course or discipline while navigating the culture along with a faculty member and fellow Hokies. Additionally, through Virginia Tech's international partnerships and membership in the International Student Exchange Program (ISEP) consortium, students can study on exchange for a semester or year at one of over 200 universities worldwide, where they are immersed in the local classroom, culture and community. Students who participate in bilateral and ISEP student exchange programs pay their regular home campus tuition and fees for the term of study, and tuition at the host university is waived. Semester exchanges serve all majors and are available in Latin America (Central and South), Europe (including Iceland and Scandinavia), Africa (North and Sub-Saharan), the Middle East, Asia (East and Southeast), and Oceania. Semester/academic year programs are also available through other study abroad third-party or non-Virginia Tech providers. Students should meet with an academic advisor early in the study abroad planning process to determine how classes taken abroad will fit into a degree program and how credit is awarded. Students must obtain pre- approval for all credits to be transferred to Virginia Tech for use toward degree completion and must register their study abroad program with the Global Education Office. All non-VT credits taken abroad return as transfer credit: the grade does not appear on the VT transcript and is not factored into the GPA. For course credit to transfer, an equivalent grade of \"C\" or better is required and courses must be reported on an official transcript either from an institution recognized by the Ministry of Education and authorized to grant degrees in its home country or from a US-accredited college or university. A minimum of 25% of the credits for the degree must be earned at Virginia Tech. Of the last 45 hours before graduation, only 18 semester hours may be transferred from another institution. A course passed at VT takes priority over a transfer equivalent course. Pass/Fail, extra credit, home study courses, correspondence courses, terminal or vocational courses do not transfer. Online courses are eligible for transfer. If completing more than one degree (not a second major) only courses for the primary degree will transfer. Students completing more than one degree (not a second major) must complete an extra 30 hours for their second degree in residence (at Virginia Tech). Authorization is denied if a student is on academic suspension while taking the course(s). Transfer credits do not affect GPA, but professional and graduate schools will typically review the grades on the original transcript. Apart from credits, students and parents considering study abroad programs typically have questions regarding costs. Program costs can vary largely depending on various factors including location, length, and program type. Most forms of financial aid may be applied to study abroad, and there are several scholarships and grants available. Students are encouraged to contact the Office of Scholarships and Financial Aid as soon as they consider studying abroad. For all questions regarding study abroad, students are encouraged to visit the Global Education Office website or visit the office to speak with an advisor. The Global Education Office strives to strengthen the university's mission of global engagement, discovery, and service by connecting faculty and students to peers abroad; inspiring and contributing to the faculty's creation and promotion of cross-cultural learning experiences; and supporting the development of Virginia Tech students into globally competent citizens. For more information, contact the Global Education Office at 526 Prices Fork Road, Room 131, or consult: www.globaleducation.vt.edu.Graduation Requirements and Degree Conferrals The approved requirements in effect for the year/term of application for degree apply. A student must complete all courses with at least a minimum 2.00 GPA for all hours attempted. In addition, a student must present an equally satisfactory record in courses attempted in the major and/or any minor. The number of credit hours required varies from one major to another. Virginia Tech reserves the right to modify requirements in the student's program if necessary. Degree r must be approved two years prior to their effective use. The approved graduation requirements (referenced as graduation checksheets) appear at the University Registrar website: https://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html. All students must earn 25% of credits required for their respective degree from Virginia Tech. No more than fifty (50) percent of credit hours earned from a two year institution may be used to satisfy graduation requirements. Students who must enroll in foreign language courses to complete admission requirements may not use the credits toward completion of the degree. Undergraduate students are permitted to complete a maximum of 18 of their last 45 hours in absentia and to transfer to complete their graduation requirements, so long as the request to transfer these credits meets all the current requirements in effect (transfer transcript is required and approval of the student's Academic Dean). In addition, the credits to be transferred may consist of required as well as elective credits as long as prior approval has been obtained from the student's Academic Dean to transfer any required credits. Undergraduate students studying away from campus during their last 45 hours may apply for an individual waiver of the requirement that a maximum of 18 of their last 45 hours may be earned in absentia. Approval of the request will be at the discretion of their academic dean. This does not preclude the requirement that at least 25% of all credits be earned in residence at Virginia Tech. Graduation with Distinction (Academic Policies Governing Enrollment Section) Language Study Requirement Students must meet a language study requirement either through middle and high school enrollment or prior to receipt of the undergraduate degree. The minimum requirement may be met in middle or high school by completing two units of a single foreign or classical language or American Sign Language. Some majors in the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences may require 3 units of a single foreign or classical language or American Sign Language. Students completing the requirement at Virginia Tech may not count the hours toward degree completion. The requirement also may be met after admission by one of the following: Earning six (6) semester hours of college-level foreign or classical language credit or American Sign Language. Such credits are in addition to that number normally required for graduation in a student's program of study. Receiving credit by examination for a foreign or classical language or American Sign Language. The credit by examination option is available only to students who have gained knowledge of a foreign language without the benefit of formal training. This privilege is intended to recognize informal non- academic learning experience and is not offered to a student who has had regular classroom instruction in that foreign language. Contact the Department of Modern and Classical Languages and Literatures for more information. Honor Code and Honor System The Virginia Tech Honor Code is the university policy that defines the expected standards of conduct in academic affairs. The Virginia Tech honor pledge is as follows: \"As a Hokie, I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat, or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do.\" Further, students are prohibited from giving and/or receiving unauthorized assistance on their course work. Each student who enrolls at Virginia Tech is responsible for abiding by the Honor Code. A student who has doubts about how the Honor Code applies to any graded assignment is responsible for obtaining specific guidance from the instructor before submitting the assignment for evaluation. Students should assume that all projects and homework assignments are to be completed individually unless otherwise specified by theinstructor. Commission of any of the following acts shall constitute academic misconduct. This listing is not, however, exclusive of other acts that may reasonably be said to constitute academic misconduct. CHEATING - The intentional use of unauthorized materials, information, notes, study aids or other devices or materials in any academic exercise, or attempts thereof. PLAGIARISM - The copying of the language, structure, programming, computer code, ideas, and/or thoughts of another and passing off the same as one's own original work, or attempts thereof. FALSIFICATION - The statement of any untruth, either verbally or in writing, with respect to any element of one's academic work, or attempts thereof. FABRICATION - Making up data and results, and recording or reporting them, or submitting fabricated documents, or attempts thereof. MULTIPLE SUBMISSION - The submission for credit without authorization of the instructor receiving the work of substantial portions of any work (including oral reports) previously submitted for credit at any academic institution, or attempts thereof. COMPLICITY - Intentionally helping another to engage in an act of academic misconduct, or attempts thereof. VIOLATION OF UNIVERSITY, COLLEGE, DEPARTMENTAL, PROGRAM, COURSE, OR FACULTY RULES - The violation of any University, College, Departmental, Program, or Faculty Rules relating to academic matters that may lead to an unfair academic advantage by the student violating the rule(s). Instances of academic misconduct represent behavior that is of an especially serious nature. The University's normal sanction for academic misconduct is an F* as the student's final course grade. The F* sanction is intended to identify a student who has failed to uphold the values of academic integrity at Virginia Tech. A student who is assessed a sanction of F* as their final course grade shall have it documented on their transcript with the notation \"FAILURE DUE TO ACADEMIC HONOR CODE VIOLATION.\" More severe or lesser penalties may be imposed if the circumstances warrant. The Honor Code fosters an environment that promotes fairness, personal responsibility, and integrity. More information about the Honor Code is available at www.honorsystem.vt.edu. Pre-Professional Preparation Pre-Law Advising Law students and lawyers come from many undergraduate backgrounds, and the skills necessary to succeed in law school and as an attorney can be developed in a variety of courses across a range of disciplines. Law schools do not treat any specific course or major as a prerequisite for admission, nor do they look with special favor on applicants who have graduated from a formal \"pre-law\" program. Accordingly, Virginia Tech does not offer a formal pre-law major. The university does offer a top-quality education in a large number of fields, as well as counseling about law as a career, preparing for and applying to law schools, and the law school admission process. Students are encouraged to maintain contact with the University pre-law advisors, the Career and Professional Development office, and others on campus with information about legal careers. For further information on pre-law studies at Virginia Tech, including how to contact the University pre-law advisors, see the following website: http://www.prelaw.psci.vt.edu. Restricted Majors and Programs Students should be aware that there are some academic majors and programs within the university that have strict entrance requirements or are in such high demand that they cannot accommodate all who wish to enter them. Administrators of these restricted programs must be selective in allowing students to transfer in from other majors within the university and in permitting second majors or minors. Students seeking entrance into such restricted programs should consult the appropriate department.Restricted programs for internal transfers are as follows: College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise College of Architecture & Urban Studies Architecture Art (Visual Communication Design; Studio Art) Industrial Design - major Industrial Design - minor Interior Design - major Landscape Architecture Pamplin College of Business Accounting Business Information Technology Business Minor Finance, Ins, & Bus Law Hospitality and Tourism Management Management Marketing College of Engineering All Engineering Majors College of Science Biological Sciences Selecting/Changing a Major, Double Major, or Minor Undergraduate students must be enrolled in the major(s) in which their degree is to be awarded before their senior year, or with a minimum of 30 semester hours to complete before their graduation. Students seeking a double major must be accepted into the second major by the academic department before the university can award the second major. Changes from one degree program to another (i.e., changes in major) or the addition of a second major or minor may sometimes imply extra course work, which can delay graduation, but changes or additions in most instances require no particular qualifications on part of the student. They usually can be accomplished prior to the senior year, simply by working with one's academic advisor and informing the head(s) of the department(s) and the dean(s) of the college(s) in question. A major (or second major) cannot be selected after the beginning of the senior year. (See section above on Selecting a Major.) Some departments establish specific deadlines for requesting change of major. Check the department's website for specific deadlines and required application materials. Minors are offered by many academic departments and earned simultaneously with the degree. Minors are not declared nor earned after degree completion. Refer to the section on Graduation Requirements and Degrees and to the appropriate academic department in the college chapters of this catalog to review the requirements for a minor. Twenty-five percent of the credit hours required for a student's degree must be taken at Virginia Tech. Procedures to Follow When Changing or Adding a Major or Minor Students can request a new primary major through Hokie Spa when a change of major time begins. There are three common change of major times every year, fall, spring and summer. Each respective college facilitates their own process to determine if it will accept the student into the major and will then notify them.The procedure for adding second majors or adding a minor is as follows: 1. Request an \"Application for Change in Curriculum\" from the office of the dean of your new curriculum. 2. Follow the instructions given on the \"Application for Change in Curriculum\" form. Selection of Studies The regular academic year at Virginia Tech is divided into two semesters, fall and spring. Virginia Tech also offers two summer sessions and one winter session. Most courses of study require eight (8) terms (i.e., semesters and/or summer sessions) for completion of the bachelor's degree requirements. Completion of the degree requirements for those students who enroll in the Cooperative Education Program, Bachelor of Architecture Program, or Bachelor of Landscape Architecture Program requires five years. Elective courses are chosen through consultation with the student's advisor. The dean of the college in which a student is registered has authority in such matters as substitution of courses, dropping and adding courses after deadlines, or permission to take an overload. Students have the assistance of faculty guidance, introductory courses, and special counseling to help them choose wisely which course of study they should take. Every effort is made to assure that all courses listed under the various department of instruction will be offered. Virginia Tech reserves the right, however, to withdraw any course for which an inadequate number of students enroll. Student Responsibilities on Official Student Records Students are responsible for keeping and being familiar with their own records and for the accuracy of these records. A student's failure to keep their address updated does not absolve the student of responsibility for matters that require notification by the university. Changes to a student's local address, permanent address, or parent/guardian address should be promptly updated by accessing Hokie SPA. Correct residence hall addresses are established through the Housing and Residence Life Office in 144 New Hall West. If a student is not sure what addresses are on file, they may check Hokie SPA for verification. Virginia Tech requires updating of local address, designation of emergency contact, opt in/out of VT Alerts, and understanding of the Hokie Handbook prior to registration. It is the student's responsibility to check their current schedule of classes by accessing Hokie SPA. Errors must be corrected by the established deadline stated in the Timetable of Classes. Request for course(s) will result in a responsibility for payment of tuition and fees. If a student requests courses via course request or during drop/add, the student is responsible for the tuition and fees assessed unless formally resigning during the established university deadlines. It is the student's responsibility to complete and return the Withdrawal/Resignation form by established term deadlines if choosing to disenroll for a given term. Students are responsible for seeing their advisors during course request to assure appropriate curricula planning. Student Responsibilities: Satisfactory Progress Towards Degree It is the student's responsibility to satisfy all course requirements as established by the faculty teaching the courses in which they are enrolled. It is also the student's responsibility to be aware of all major, degree, college, and graduation requirements necessary to complete their degree. Additionally, students are responsible for satisfying all university, college, and departmental requirements for progress towards degree. (Consult \"Checksheets\" at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for major requirements.)Student Success Center www.studentsuccess.vt.edu (540) 231-5499 The Student Success Center supports undergraduate learning from enrollment to degree completion by offering programs and services that help students become effective, self-motivated learners. The department offers academic support, such as academic coaching, tutoring, and study skills seminars to undergraduates. Programs and activities for students who are already succeeding academically, and simply want to enrich their educational experiences at Virginia Tech are also available. All SSC programs and services are free to Virginia Tech students. The main office is located on the first floor of Femoyer Hall where we also have a classroom, tutoring spaces, and staff offices. Educator (Teacher) Preparation www.soe.vt.edu edinfo@vt.edu Virginia Tech's School of Education offers programs leading to licensure in 17 fields of study. All educator preparation programs are at the graduate level. Students seeking a teaching or other educational license should consult the School of Education Office of Academic Programs website (http://www.oap.soe.vt.edu) for details on specific programs of interest. Generally, the educator preparation programs are completed in one calendar year of full-time enrollment, including student teaching. The School of Education is accredited by the National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education, and all programs are approved by the Virginia Board of Education. Graduates may qualify for an educator license or endorsement in other states. Undergraduate students who anticipate applying for a master's degree in education should consult the Pre- Education Advisor at https://sites.google.com/vt.edu/peap/home or peap@vt.edu or the academic advisor in their undergraduate major. Decisions about entering graduate programs in education should be made early in the undergraduate years so that an appropriate major can be selected and required courses can be taken prior to applying for the graduate program. For certain programs, seniors with a GPA of 3.0 or better may apply to be admitted to the Dual Student Status for their last semester to take graduate-level education courses and juniors with a GPA of 3.3 or better may apply for admission in the Accelerated Undergraduate/Graduate Degree Program to take graduate courses during the senior year. Information about these options is available on the Graduate School website (www.graduateschool.vt.edu) Applicants for educator preparation programs must submit passing scores on Praxis Core Academic Skills for Educators, or acceptable scores on the SAT or ACT prior to acceptance into the School of Education. Passing scores on relevant Praxis Subject Assessments, the Virginia Communication and Literacy Assessment, and the Reading for Virginia Educators exam (for elementary education teachers) are required prior to receiving a teaching license and prior to admission for some programs. A criminal record check is required by school divisions in Virginia prior to employment, and for most divisions for student teaching. Notable features of the educator preparation program at Virginia Tech are: graduates with a commitment to learning and advocacy for all students a faculty devoted to improving education through research, teaching, and outreach an emphasis on science, math, and technology within a comprehensive School of Education graduates with expertise in content fields and related pedagogical knowledge and skills committed clinical supervisors in schools field experiences and internships in diverse school settings the latest instructional technologies a strong demand for our graduates Applications for School of Education programs may be submitted on line through the Graduate Schoolwebsite: www.graduateschool.vt.edu. Undergraduate Courses of Study Undergraduate courses of study leading to bachelor's degrees at Virginia Tech are listed below. In addition, many options and specialties pertaining to each academic college are described in the individual college sections in this catalog.

Registration for continuing students is an eight-day period (Course Request) in the middle of each semester during which currently enrolled students may request classes for the next semester. Students register for summer school (if they plan to attend) beginning in December. Students register for fall semester during spring semester. a. Students should consult their completed Pathways Planner and review it with their departmental advisor. Both should be aware of such considerations as the student's current GPA, the course load in hours and in effort required, pre- and co-requisites for courses so limited, the student's relationship to the eligibility schedule, and fulfillment of Curriculum for Liberal Education (Pathways) requirements and those for major, minor, or cognate. If the student fails to meet with their advisor, a hold may be placed on their registration. b. When a schedule is designed, the student utilizes the course request module in Hokie SPA to enter the course requests. c. Prerequisite checking is enforced by some departments. The registration system will review the student's academic history to determine compliance with any prerequisites. d. Overloads (more than 19 hours per semester, seven each summer session, or six for winter session) require permission of the student's academic dean. The student will be scheduled for the first available 19 hours (seven in summer and six in winter) requested. e. Every student must annually provide an up-to-date local address, an emergency contact, opt in/opt out of the VT Alerts system and all students must acknowledge the continuing duty to report arrests and convictions to the University. Students are prohibited from registration until the requirements are updated in the student record system. f. The student's current class schedule may be printed by accessing Hokie SPA; the student is then responsible for verifying that they are in fact enrolled in the courses and sections they have been attending. 2. Approximately three weeks after the close of registration week, course request results are available andmay be accessed through Hokie SPA. The web class ticket will include detailed information regarding sections which are full, conflicting, withdrawn, or restricted which explains why these sections were not added to the student's schedule. See item number six (6) below for details about why a student's course selections are sometimes ignored, or why a student's schedule might be purged or held from registration. 3. Students may adjust their schedules on a space available basis using web drop/add, an electronic schedule adjustment program. Students should consult with their advisors before making any changes except those for convenience (usually time). 1000-level Mathematics and English courses, because of the high demand, currently have restrictions on section changes. As a rule, any student who drops a 1000-level English or Math course via Hokie SPA or department will not be allowed to force-add another 1000-level English or Math course that term. A student should be aware that dropping below full-time status (12 semester hours) may jeopardize financial aid, campus housing, and degree completion. Some courses may drop students for failing to attend the first class. Refer to the comments section of the course in the Timetable of Classes. 4. A Force-Add form permits admission to a class over the desired enrollment threshold, but not over room capacity. This request is submitted via a \"force-add\" form available in the department offering the course, and requires the instructor's (or, in some departments, departmental) permission. Requests for force-adds are processed by the department offering the course. Caution: The force-add transaction permits enrollment in courses with conflicting times. 5. Responsibility for Payment of Tuition and Fees: all students who initiate enrollment either by course request or by drop/add are responsible for the payment of assessed tuition and fees. Only the submission of an official withdrawal or resignation removes the student from any applicble fee responsibility. Failure to attend class(es) or to submit appropriate university paperwork is not a justifiable reason for removal of assessed fees retroactively. 6. Late Adds and Drops Adjustments to a student's schedule after the last date to carry out a specific transaction (see Hokie SPA for deadline dates) require permission of their own academic dean. Thus, a Business major wishing to late-drop an English course requires approval from the College of Business, not that of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences. A late-drop request based on mental or physical illness requires a recommendation from Schiffert Health Center and/or Cook Counseling Center. Faculty cannot add or drop students from their rosters. 7. Purged and Held Registrations Failure to pay tuition bills by a posted deadline (usually by the end of the second week of classes) may result in the student's schedule being purged (removed from the system). A schedule may be held (made inaccessible to department staff, as well as to students using drop/add, thereby precluding transactions of any type) for nonpayment of fees other than tuition (e.g., parking tickets), for Honor Code or Student Conduct violations, for academic ineligibility (due to department and/or academic suspension), or for failure to make progress toward a degree. This last hold is imposed by the student's dean, while all other holds are imposed by other offices. The student should check with the office imposing the hold, as only that office is authorized to remove the hold. The Office of the University Bursar processes all billing for tuition and fees; contact the Office of the Bursar if you have questions about your bill or do not receive a bill. \u00a9 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the University RegistrarMenu 2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and"

Students presenting appeals based on medical reasons must request recommendations from the Student Health Evaluation Committee. Students may appeal other academic decisions made by their college associate dean to the college dean. Auditing Courses A student may enroll as an auditor in any class other than laboratory classes and studio courses, with the permission of both their academic advisor and the class instructor. The lecture portion of laboratory-linked courses and courses with computation periods may be designated as eligible for audit at the request of the academic department head (of the course in question) and on the approval of the student's academic dean. Auditors may not add or drop an audit option after the last day to enter classes. Students will not be allowed to register for credit in any course previously audited. Students may not unofficially attend class(es).Class Level A student must have received credit for at least 30 hours to be classified as a sophomore, at least 60 hours to be classified as a junior, and at least 90 hours to be classified as a senior. Course Prerequisites (University Policy) Many course offering departments enforce prerequisite checking at registration. The automated system checks the student's academic history and/or current enrollment for verification of compliance. Students without the required prerequisite will be prohibited from enrolling. On occasion, students are permitted to take courses without having the specified prerequisites only upon obtaining the consent of the instructor. Students who enroll in a course for which they clearly have not satisfied the prerequisites or equivalent or obtained the appropriate permission may be dropped from the course. Deliberately false statements testifying to the satisfaction of prerequisites constitute a violation of the honor code. Students have the right to appeal a decision about prerequisites to the head of the department offering a course. Students should recognize that 3000 and 4000 level courses assume a certain level of academic maturity and general background regardless of the stated prerequisites. The course instructor can be consulted regarding the implications of this expectation for a specific course. Enrollment (Semester Hour) Minimum full-time enrollment for undergraduate and associate degree students is 12 hours per semester in regular A-F option or P/F option. For each summer session, the minimum is 5 hours. Audit hours are not used in establishing minimum full-time enrollments. Full-time enrollment for graduate students is 9 hours or more in regular A-F option, P/F option, or equivalent credit. For each summer term, the minimum is 3 hours. Neither the payment of full fees nor compliance with maximums established as a condition of employment or appointment is a basis for deviation from the definition above. Graduation with Distinction Graduating with distinction is an honor bestowed on those who earn a 3.4 or higher and who complete no less than 60 hours at Virginia Tech. Distinction is denoted on the diploma and on the transcript. Levels of distinction are: Students with a cumulative GPA of 3.8 or greater are graduated Summa Cum Laude. Students with a cumulative GPA of 3.6-3.7999 are graduated Magna Cum Laude. Students with a cumulative GPA of 3.4-3.5999 are graduated Cum Laude. Grade Point Averages are not rounded in qualifying a student for distinction. In computing eligibility for graduation with distinction, only undergraduate level work attempted at Virginia Tech will be used. Students may not use hours earned at Virginia Tech as an associate, professional, or graduate level as part of the 60 semester hours required to earn distinction. The notation of distinction on the diploma and on the transcript is independent of the notation of a degree in honors, if applicable. (See section on \"The Honors Program\" for information about graduating in honors.) Limits on Acceptable Credits for Degrees Not more than 6 credit hours earned from extension courses, radio courses, television courses, and intensive courses (e.g. taken while in active military service, etc.) will be accepted for undergraduate degree credit. Thirty-eight hours of advanced placement credit and/or international baccalaureate and/or Cambridge International Examination credit may be accepted towards the undergraduate degree.Readmission through University Registrar or Academic Dean Formerly enrolled students who have greater than the 2.0 GPA overall may seek readmission via web course request form if they are eligible to return. Students returning from academic suspension should consult their academic dean's office for readmission procedures. (These procedures vary from college to college within the university.) Formerly enrolled students, not in good academic standing who stop enrollment or resign for personal reasons, and later complete course work at another college or university are required to submit their transfer transcripts to certify good standing at all institutions. Academic standing and student conduct at other institutions are considered in the deliberation for approval for readmission. Formerly enrolled students in good academic standing who resign for personal reasons, do not continue enrollment at Virginia Tech, and later complete course work at another college or university are required to submit their transfer transcripts to their academic dean prior to or during their first term of re-enrollment. Registration Requirements Demographic Information: Virginia Tech policy requires annually the collection of specific demographic data for each student: emergency contact entry or emergency contact confirmation, and VT alerts Opt In or Opt Out action. Local Mailing Address: Virginia Tech policy requires the updating of a student\u2019s local mailing address to reflect the local residential address while enrolled in school. Conduct Policy: Students must annually acknowledge the Virginia Tech\u2019s Student Conduct policy on Arrests and Convictions. The University enacted policy requiring all students, regardless of academic level or campus, to report any arrests, convictions, and/or protective orders to the university. VT Alerts: Students must opt in or opt out of the Virginia Tech alert system annually. Students will be prohibited from registration until the above information is provided. Missing Person Contact: Student(s) may denote a specific third party as emergency contact as primary in cases of missing person(s). Visit Hokie SPA, choose the Hokie Plus menu, add \u2018new emergency contact\u2019. In the pull down selection for relationships, choose \u00ab Missing Persons Contact \u00bb. In the case of such an emergency, the university will first contact the missing person designee before any alternate emergency contact(s). Resignations A student may resign without academic penalty by completing an official Virginia Tech resignation form on or before the published resignation deadline for each term. The student can request this resignation form from either the University Registrar's Office, the University Registrar's website, or the academic Dean's Office. The student's grade report and permanent record will show that he/she was enrolled for the term and that he/she resigned on the specific effective date. A student who resigns after the stated deadline without written authorization for resignation-without-penalty by the respective academic dean will receive automatic \"F\" grades in all courses in which the student is enrolled. The transcript will carry the notation, \"Suspended by committee action for unauthorized resignation,\" and the hours for which \"F\" grades were received will be included in the cumulative GPA for both academic eligibility and graduation requirements. In the case of authorized resignations after the deadline, grades will not be assigned, and the academic deanwill determine the student's academic status (whether or not he/she is eligible to return) based on the student's previous record. Satisfactory Progress University policy requires that all students meet the following minimum criteria to be certified as making satisfactory progress toward a degree. Have an overall grade point average at or above that specified in the academic eligibility schedule (determined at the end of the Spring semester). Upon having attempted 36 semester credits (including transfer, advanced placement, advanced standing, credit by examination, and freshman rule hours), students must have passed at least 12 semester credits of Curriculum for Liberal Education requirements. Upon having attempted 72 semester credits (including transfer, advanced placement, advanced standing, credit by examination, freshman rule hours), students must: have passed at least 24 semester credits of Curriculum for Liberal Education requirements be enrolled in a degree-granting program and be certified at the close of the academic year by their department as making satisfactory progress toward a degree, based upon pre-established minimum criteria from departmental checksheets. Upon having attempted 96 semester credits (including transfer, advanced placement, advanced standing, credit by examination, and freshman rule hours), students must have an in-major grade point average of 2.0 or above. Colleges and departments may impose additional requirements. It is the student's responsibility to become familiar with the requirements of his or her college. Transfer Work while on Suspension A student may not receive credit for course work taken at another college or university during any period in which the student has been placed on suspension by Virginia Tech for academic or disciplinary reasons. Undergraduate taking Graduate Courses Undergraduate students may enroll in graduate-level course work in the senior year, provided they have an overall GPA of 3.0 or above and the written approval of the department head and the Graduate School. To enroll in graduate-level course work, the undergraduate student must apply to the Graduate School as a dual registrant. Each term that a student is dually enrolled, he or she must fill out a form in the University Registrar's Office to indicate which courses are being counted for undergraduate credit and which for graduate credit. If graduate courses are used to satisfy undergraduate degree requirements, they cannot be used to satisfy any advanced degree requirements at Virginia Tech. Students may not concurrently have dual status while enrolled in an Undergraduate Dual status. Graduate courses may not be taken without prior written approval from the Graduate School. Accelerated Undergraduate/Graduate Degree status High achieving and talented seniors may apply for Accelerated status. The minimum admission requirements are: An advisor for the proposed accelerated program Listing of courses for use on the plan of study Minimum grade point average of 3.3 Some programs may include additional requirements The Accelerated Undergraduate/Graduate Degree status allows students with specific qualifications to allowcertain courses to count toward both the undergraduate and graduate degree: No more than twelve (12) credit hours may be used. All courses must be at the 4000 level or higher. No more than six (6) credit hours may be used at the 4000 level. A grade of B or higher must be earned in each course. No courses may be taken pass/fail. 125 Percent Rule for In-State Tuition The Code of Virginia establishes rules for eligibility for in-state tuition for all students enrolled at public institutions in the Commonwealth of Virginia. Section 23-7.4:F of the Code of Virginia further requires undergraduate students to maintain progress toward the degree to comply with continued eligibility for in-state tuition. Students with entry dates Fall 2006 and after may not exceed attempted hours that total 125% of the minimum credit hours needed for a specific degree program and retain in-state tuition eligibility. Students exceeding 125% will be assessed a surcharge for each semester of continued enrollment after exceeding the credit hour threshold. For the purpose of this state law, all credits attempted (Virginia Tech and Transfer) are used in the calculation of the percentage. The requirement does allow the subtraction of credits awarded for Advanced Placement, Advanced Standing, International Baccalaureate, and Credit by Exam from the attempted totals. Important resources to assist you so as to avoid the credit hour surcharge are: Undergraduate Degree Hours and 125% Tuition Credit Hour Threshold Table (http://www.registrar.vt.edu/academic_records/in-state/125-percent-table.html) Credit Hour Surcharge Costs, Virginia Tech Bursar (http://www.bursar.vt.edu/tuition) Click on \"surcharge\" link. Please note that the Excess Credit Hour Tuition surcharge is per credit hour. To calculate the total surcharge for a term, multiply the surcharge amount per credit hour by the number of credit hours enrolled (up to 12 credit hours per semester; 5 credit hours per summer term). State Code of Virginia, Section 23-7.4:F Students with declared second majors and minors: the total credits additional required for earning of the second degree and/or minor will be added to the total prior to computing the 125 percentage. For example, as student\u2019s first degree requires 120 hours. The second degree requires 30 additional hours. The 125% will be computed based on 150 hours. \u00a9 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the University RegistrarMenu 2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and"

Directory information at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University includes: Student's Name Local and Permanent Address(es) Telephone Number(s) VT Email Address Major Field of Study (Including Second Majors, Minors, etc.) Whether a Student is Currently Enrolled Enrollment Status (Full-time, Half-time, etc.) Class (Freshman, Sophomore, etc.) Academic Level (Associate, Undergraduate, Graduate, Professional) Anticipated Date of Graduation Certification of Application for Degree Dates of Enrollment Degree(s) Earned (Including Date, Honors and Level of Distinction) Participation in Officially Recognized Activities and Sports Weight and Height of Members of Athletic Teams Electronic Theses and Dissertations (ETD)Directory information will be withheld upon the written request of the student. Such prohibition against release generally does not extend to record requests from other school officials at this institution who have an educational need to know, state and federal education authorities, courts or accrediting organizations. Questions concerning this policy may be referred to the Office of the University Registrar. FERPA Disclosure Due to the laws covering confidentiality, it is a violation of the regulations for anyone to release non-directory information (grades, course enrollment, class schedule, standing) about any student to anyone without permission from the student. The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) requires the student to authorize the university prior to release of any academic record information to a third party. Completion of the online form (Hokie SPA) allows the student to approve disclosure of his/her academic record information to parent(s) and/or guardian(s) via an assigned \"Pass Code\". University officials must request the pass code prior to the release of any requested information. The disclosure will remain valid until the student removes the authorization. Tax Dependent? The Commonwealth of Virginia requires Virginia's colleges and universities to release academic record information to parents of tax dependent students. This requirement is allowable within the guidelines of FERPA. If the student is a tax dependent of his/her parent or guardian, please denote that information by checking \"YES\" in the question column, \"Are you a Tax Dependent?\" on the online FERPA disclosure form (Hokie SPA). Students are informed of any release of information prior to disclosure. Notification of Rights Under FERPA The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include the following: 1. The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. Students must submit to the Office of the University Registrar written requests that identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The university official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. 2. The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading. They should write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify what is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student when notified of the right to a hearing. 3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student's education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests or concerns of health and safety. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisor, academic or research, or support staff position (such as health staff); a person or company with whom the university has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Visitors; or a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. 4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Virginia Tech to comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is:Family Policy Compliance Office U.S. Department of Education 400 Maryland Avenue, SW Washington, DC 20202-5920 http://www.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html Students may also file a complaint with the University Registrar: Rick Sparks 250 Student Services Building Blacksburg, Virginia 24061-0134 (540) 231-7951 The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act indicates that students and former students should be granted the opportunity to change their names on education records upon the production of evidence showing that the name has changed. The following procedure applies to requests for changes to the name appearing on a student's education record: Complete Request for Change in Name form in the Office of the University Registrar Provide a photocopy of a Social Security card that reflects the new name and a valid drivers license or other form of photo identification Provide a photocopy of a birth certificate, marriage certificate or license, divorce decree, court order, or naturalization papers including certificate number, petition number, and registration number Please note that all documentation used in support of this request should reflect the name for which you are requesting the change. The Privacy Act of 1974 (U.S. Public Law 93-579, Sect. 7) requires that the university notify students that disclosure of a Social Security number is voluntary unless employed by the university or receiving federal financial aid. Pursuant to the 2003 State Code of the Commonwealth of Virginia, no student identification card may display the social security number as an identifier. Effective with students entering Fall 2003 and beyond, a generated identification number will be utilized as the default unique identifier. This generated number will be nine digits in length and will begin with the number, \"9\", nine. The generated student identification is defined as personally identifiable information by federal legislation, FERPA (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act) (U.S. Public Law 93-579, Sect. 7), and is prohibited from disclosure except to education officials with legitimate educational interest. For students who entered Virginia Tech prior to Fall 2003, the social security number was the default student identification number. Effective with the entering class of Fall 2003, a nine digit generated identifier is assigned to each student. Use this identifier when the student identification number is requested by a university official. Important note: disclosure of the social security number may be required by different university offices if required by the Code of the Commonwealth of Virginia or Federal statute. Required Demographic Information Virginia Tech policy requires annually the collection of specific demographic data for each student: local mailing address, emergency contact entry or emergency contact confirmation, VT Alerts Opt In or Opt Out action, and review of the Virginia Tech Student Conduct Policy. Students will be prohibited from registration until the information is provided. Missing Person Contact Student(s) may denote a specific third party as emergency contact as primary in cases of missing person(s). Visit Hokie SPA, choose the Hokie Plus menu, add 'new emergency contact'. In the pull down selection for relationships, choose \"Missing Persons Contact\". In case of such an emergency, the University will first contact the missing person designee before any alternate emergency contact(s).Menu 2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and"

In accordance with state policy, Virginia Tech accepts credit from Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and Cambridge Exam based on annual faculty and university program review. College Level Examination Program (CLEP) CLEP is a national program that offers students credit by computer-based examination. This allows students to have the opportunity to obtain recognition for achievement in specific college courses. Students should request their official CLEP exam results directly from the College Board at: www.collegeboard.com. Virginia Tech's CLEP school code is 5859. CLEP credit can be viewed on Hokie SPA under the grades menu. A maximum of 12 credit hours may be awarded.Refer to the Office of the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.vt.edu/registration-multi-brief/ap- ib-clep-credit.html for information and to view the CLEP Credit Table. Questions about CLEP credit should be directed to the Office of the University Registrar at registrar@vt.edu. Credit by Examination Credit may be allowed by special examination where exceptional command of a subject can be demonstrated in lieu of formal course work. This privilege is not available to a student who has previously audited or enrolled in the course, or has previously attempted credit by examination in the course. If credit by examination is deemed appropriate, the offering department shall have full responsibility for determining the type of examination to be given and what constitutes a passing grade. A maximum of 12 hours may be awarded. Credit established by examination may not be used to satisfy the in-residence requirements for graduation. No grades or quality credits will be assigned. There is a per-credit fee for the examination. The current fee is $10.00 per credit hour and is subject to change at the beginning of an academic year. Only currently enrolled undergraduate students are eligible for special examinations allowing university credit. Official approval must be obtained from the head of the department offering the course. Credit for ROTC Courses In some majors, not all ROTC courses may be applied toward a bachelor's degree. Students should consult their approved major checksheet for specific information on which courses will count toward their degree. Credit Hour System Virginia Tech uses the credit-hour as its unit of credit in the semester calendar system. Course descriptions under the departments of instruction (in the chapters on the various colleges) indicate the number of credits received per term. Dean's List Undergraduate students who attempt at least 12 credit hours with all credits graded on the A-F option and who earn a 3.4 GPA for either spring or fall semester will be included on the Dean's List for that term. The Deans' Lists are not compiled for summer sessions. Any notifications or certificates indicating inclusion on the Dean's List for a particular term are issued by the student's academic dean. Examinations and Re-Examinations Final examinations are held at the close of each term according to a schedule established by the university. An instructor may not change the date or time of a final exam without the approval of the dean of the college. Students may request permission from their college dean to reschedule a final exam if they have conflicting exams or if they have three final exams in 24 hours. Otherwise, permission to reschedule a final exam is granted by the dean only in very unusual circumstances. Deferred final exams may be authorized only by the student's academic dean or by the Schiffert Health Services. Re-examination of one final exam is available only for students who are candidates for degree in the same term as the final exam. After a term is over, a re-examination in one course in which the final grade earned is C- or below may be authorized if the student was enrolled in the course during the final term of his or her senior year and if a satisfactory re-examination in the course will qualify the student for graduation. The student must make the re- examination request to the dean and must complete the exam as soon as possible after the first examination.For the student to be granted a re-examination, approval is required by the instructor, the student's department head, and the student's academic dean. In determining the validity of the student's request, consideration is given to class performance and completion of assigned work. The University Registrar provides verification of compliance with the requirements of this policy. Grade Appeal Procedure As Per University policy, the assignment of a grade is the sole prerogative of the instructor of the class. It is incumbent on the instructor to establish the criteria for grading in the syllabus that is distributed at the beginning of the term. All grades are to be based on established grading criteria and not on personal conduct or opinions unrelated to academic standards. An individual student may not do extra work to raise his/her grade. If a student feels that a grade has been calculated incorrectly or has been assigned in a prejudiced or capricious manner, the student should discuss the matter with the instructor. If discussion between the instructor and the student cannot resolve the issue, the student should appeal to the department/division head. In the unusual circumstance that resolution does not occur at the departmental/divisional level, the student may appeal to the college dean who will attempt to reconcile the matter by whatever mechanism seems most appropriate for that college and for that case. A grade appeal must be made by the student as soon as possible but no later than the end of the student's subsequent term of enrollment after the grade in question has been assigned. Grades and Grade Points The academic achievement of a student in a specific course is rated as follows: Grade Points A grade of \"I\" (incomplete) may be given when the requirements Letter Grade for each hour of a course other than the final examination have not been A (Excellent) 4.0 completed due to illness or extenuating circumstances beyond A- 3.7 the student's control. The \"I\" grade is the prerogative of the B+ 3.3 instructor. To remove an \"I\" grade, lecture course requirements must be B (Good) 3.0 satisfied during the student's first subsequent term of enrollment, B- 2.7 and laboratory course requirements must be satisfied prior to the C+ 2.3 end of the first term during which the course is offered and the C (Fair) 2.0 student is enrolled. Incomplete and \"X\" grades are automatically C- 1.7 converted to \"F\" if requirements are not fully satisfied during the D+ 1.3 period of time allowed. D 1.0 An \"NR\" grade is assigned automatically by the system when a D- (Barely Passing) 0.7 student is enrolled for a class and no other grade is assigned by F (Failure) 0.0 the instructor. The \"NG\" is intended to be a grade distinguishable I (Incomplete) --- from those initially assigned by the instructor and thus to indicate NG (No Grade) --- clearly the origin of the grade. NR (Not Reported) --- \u201dW\u201d Grade: Courses from which a student withdraws under the P (Passing) --- terms of the policy, will appear on their transcript with a \"W\" RP (Repeated grade, but will not count in the GPA hours nor in any GPA --- Course) calculations. The \"W\" signifies that this policy was invoked and S (Satisfactory/credits does not reflect the rationale for its use. The reasons for use --- only) remain the student's purview. W (Course Grade Point Average (GPA) is computed by dividing the total --- Withdrawn) number of quality credits earned by the total number of hours attempted at Virginia Tech, except courses passed on a Pass/Fail basis and courses with an \"X\" (Continuing Course). \"NG\" grades are computed as \"F\" grades in determining GPA. The GPA is unaffected by the \"I\" grade, unless or until the \"I\" isconverted to an \"F\" for failure to complete the course requirements within the allotted time. All courses repeated count in the calculation of the grade point average unless changed to Pass/Fail per policy. X (Continuing --- Repeated Courses: A student may not repeat courses in order to Course) improve his or her grade average where a grade of \"C or higher has been earned. An assigned grade of \"A-D\" for the second occurrence will be changed to a grade of \"P\" whenever a graduation analysis (DARS report) detects a repeated course with a \"C\" or better grade. Repeating a course where the course is \"C-\" or below, both instances of the graded course will be computed in the grade point average. Grades (Midterm) Midterm grades are produced for freshmen and transfer students whose first term of enrollment is fall semester. Beginning Fall 1996, students whose first term of enrollment is summer will also receive a midterm grade report during fall semester. \"Satisfactory\" is given for work earning a grade of C or better and \"unsatisfactory\" is given for work earning a grade of C- or below. The midterm grade is not part of the student's permanent academic record and is only intended to be an early indication of the student's progress. Graduation Requirements (Grade Hours Passed or Completed) The \"total credits\" figure on the displayed grade report is not necessarily the same as the total hours (often referenced as hours passed) required for completion of the degree (not all credit hours are effective toward graduation requirements). Students are responsible for verifying required hours for completion by reviewing their degree analysis (DARS) with their advisor. Listed below are a few examples of typical situations yielding \"pass\" hours which must be subtracted to determine the total credits useful toward graduation requirements: Transfer and/or advanced placement credits that have been subsequently duplicated by courses at Virginia Tech. Credits earned at Virginia Tech that have been duplicated by repeating courses or taking courses ruled to have duplicating credit. Transfer credits allowed from a two-year college that are in excess of one-half of the total credit hour requirement for the curriculum. Credits for Physical Education Service Activities courses (now listed under HNFE), which exceed a total of two, the maximum allowed toward a bachelor's degree. Credits for military science that exceed the total specified by the college for the student's curriculum. Credits on the pass/fail grading system that exceed 12 credit hours allowable exclusive of pass/fall only courses. Credits for courses that do not count towards the degree, (e.g. UNIV 1004 College Success Strategies).. Obsolete Academic Records Under the \"Obsolete Academic Records Policy,\" former Virginia Tech students returning to the university after an absence of at least five years may request in writing to have their academic records evaluated by the appropriate academic dean. Such transcripts will be evaluated in the same manner that transfer student transcripts are considered; credits will be allowed only for those courses appropriate for the degree. The grades for these allowable courses will not be factored into the student's GPA, but all courses will remain partof the student's permanent record. Pass/Fail Grading System A limited pass/fail (P/F) grading system is available to encourage students to enrich their academic programs and explore more challenging courses outside their majors, without the pressures and demands of the regular grading system. The P/F grading option is available to all undergraduates who have completed a minimum of 30 credit hours at Virginia Tech and have a cumulative GPA of 2.0 or above. These restrictions do not apply to courses that are only offered P/F. No required course or course used for the Curriculum for Liberal Education may be taken on a \"P/F\" basis (unless only offered on a P/F basis). Under the pass/fail system students are allowed to attempt twelve (12) credit hours in their degree program on a pass/fail basis exclusive of courses only offered pass/fail. Students enrolled in five-year designated programs (College of Architecture and Urban Studies) may attempt twelve (12) credit hours or ten percent of the total hours required for the degree whichever is greater. Courses offered pass/fail only are not included in the twelve total hours allowable under the pass/fail system. Additional degree programs may not be used to increase the number of pass/fail credits that a student is permitted to use toward any degree. No more than two courses per term may be taken P/F, excluding physical education activity courses and required courses offered on a P/F basis only. Under the P/F grading system, a \"P\" is granted for earning a \"D\" or better in the course; otherwise, an \"F\" is given. A \"D-\" is a failing grade under the P/F option. The \"P\" or \"F\" is recorded on the student's transcript and credit is given if the course is passed. If the course is failed, the \"F\" is considered equivalent to an \"F\" received under the \"A-F\" grading system and is included in calculation of the grade point average (GPA). Once credit is received for a course taken under the P/F system, the course cannot be repeated under the \"A- F\" grading system. Any course to be taken under the P/F option should be designated as such upon request for the course. The student may change grading options to P/F until the drop deadline and to A-F until the deadline for resigning without penalty. Repeat Course Policy Beginning Fall 2016 students may only attempt a course three times. An \"attempt\" is when a student is enrolled in a course on the last day to add courses during each semester. Courses designated as repeatable credit (to the limit allowed) are excluded from this policy (e.g. independent studies, internships, etc.). All course repeats should be done in consultation with a student's academic advisor. Any student who enrolls for a fourth attempt will be dropped from the course. If a student's extenuating circumstances prevent successful completion of the course on a third attempt, the student may appeal (petition) to repeat the course again. For more information regarding the appeals process, please refer to your academic dean's office. Repeating a course subsequent times may affect financial aid and eligibility for certain programs. Students receiving financial aid should check with University Scholarships and Financial Aid to determine what, if any, financial aid implications there are for repeating courses. Veterans, athletes and international students may have additional rules associated with course repeats. Check with the appropriate department for additional information. Study Week Study week refers to the last three calendar days of classes for each semester. All written work, with the exceptions noted below, should be assigned so that it can be graded and returned during a regularly scheduled class meeting of the term. In-class hour-long examinations or other major in-class written assignments or tests shall not be given during study week. The exceptions for undergraduate courses are: Dates for turning in term papers and project reports may be set at the discretion of the instructor,provided that the student is not to be held responsible on the final examination for the subject matter therein. In laboratory courses or other courses that do not warrant a final examination during the examination period, an examination, if required by the department and/or instructor, may be given during the last regularly scheduled laboratory or class period. Regularly scheduled final examinations, when special permission has been granted by the dean of the appropriate college. Graduate courses also have specific exceptions which may differ from those for undergraduate courses. Contact the Graduate School for details. Transfer Credits Enrolled students in good standing at Virginia Tech must receive pre-approval from their academic dean's office to transfer credit to Virginia Tech. Pre-approval from the academic dean does not guarantee transfer of the course if the student has duplicate credit in the approved course. Students must review their degree requirements (viewing DARS) to assure credits are degree applicable. Students who have been placed on academic or judicial suspension by the University are not eligible to transfer credit for terms of enrollment that coincide with their suspension term(s). The rules below govern the transfer of credit on a university level. Some colleges at Virginia Tech have additional policies and procedures regarding transfer credit. Students are responsible for consulting with the academic dean's office in the appropriate college to discuss their plans to transfer credit, and to request information on the college's specific policies and procedures regarding transfer. Courses for transfer must be taken at an accredited college or university. Courses must be college-parallel, not terminal courses in a vocational program. Only courses with a \"C\" grade or better will transfer. Note: A \"C-\" will not transfer. Credits will not transfer for students who are classified as non-degree-seeking students. Course equivalencies will be determined by the Office of the University Registrar. Credit hours transfer; grades do not transfer. No more than 60 (sixty) semester hours may transfer from the Virginia Community College System (VCCS). Of the last 45 semester hours before graduation, a maximum of 18 semester hours may be transfer hours. Many colleges and universities will require a letter of good standing from Virginia Tech before they will enroll a student from another university who wishes to transfer credits back. Virginia Tech students can request this letter certifying their good standing by completing a \"Request for Certification\" form in the Office of the University Registrar. Upon completion of the course(s) and posting of grades, students are responsible for requesting that an official transcript be sent directly to the Office of the University Registrar at Virginia Tech as soon as possible, but not later than two semesters after the work is completed. \"W\" Grade Policy The policy is intended to assist undergraduate students who find themselves enrolled in undergraduate level courses for which they are insufficiently prepared, or for those who initially enroll in majors that they subsequently change. This policy allows currently enrolled students to designate a grading option of \"CW\" to a course. Courses with this option are not gradable but remain on the academic transcript with the letter grade of \"W\". A maximum of three (3) courses (regardless of credit) may be dropped beyond the normal six-week drop deadline date during a student's undergraduate academic career at Virginia Tech subject to the following stipulations: Students must formally request to apply the W Grade option to a course by the last day of classes ofeach term. The deadline appears in the deadlines listing of the online Time Table of Classes. Courses with the new grade mode of \"W\" will appear on the transcript with a \"W\" grade, but will not count in the GPA hours nor in any GPA calculations. The \"W\" signifies that this policy was invoked and does not reflect the rationale for its use. The reasons for use remains the student's purview. There are no refunds of tuition and fees as a result of application of the policy. However, utilization of this grade option policy may affect Reasonable Academic Policy requirements for continued receipt of federal financial aid. Students are urged to consult with their financial aid advisor. A student decision to invoke this policy is irrevocable and unappealable. Application of the W grade option may not be employed to reduce or obviate any penalty otherwise accruing to students under the University Honor System. Previously processed W grade options will be voided if the course is penalized per an Honor System action. Students may request a W grade option change for any course, irrespective of the evaluation earned in it up to the point of their request for withdrawal. However, if a registration hold exists at the time of application of this policy, the student must take action to remove the hold within five (5) working days of the application or the request will be voided. Students are responsible for resolving their registration holds with the appropriate university office. Students already enrolled when this policy takes effect who have exercised their option to use the previously existing Freshman Rule shall not be eligible to use this policy. To exercise this option, interested students should see their academic advisor to obtain a course withdrawal form and submit it to their designated departmental representative and academic dean for approval. \u00a9 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the University RegistrarMenu 2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and"

Specifically, it is recommended that a minimum of seven (7) academic units be completed during the last two years of high school with at least three (3) academic units completed each year in the most rigorous academic programs available. Each application is evaluated holistically to include a student's academic performance combined with personal attributes. Primary criteria used for holistic review include rigor of academic course selection, grades in academic courses, and standardized test (SAT or ACT) performance. Other criteria include, but are not limited to, personal strengths such as overcoming adversity, leadership appointments, and athletic accomplishments.Considerations are also given to applicants who apply as a dependent of alumni of Virginia Tech, special talents, first-generation college attendee, interest in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, legacy, major, ethnicity, residency, disciplinary record, and veteran status. Recommendation letters will not be considered for admissions review. For the 2017 fall semester, those offered admission had a middle 50th percentile of GPAs of 3.78-4.23 and a middle 50th percentile of combined SATs (critical reading and math) of 1160-1340. Competitive freshman applicants will have A/B grades in a rigorous curriculum and strong SAT or ACT scores. Students who intend to compete in intercollegiate athletics are also required to meet all NCAA and ACC requirements for admission. Prospective music students must schedule an audition with the music department. Applicants who wish to request an audition should contact the department head by January 1 of the senior year in high school. Admission (Undergraduate) Prospective students and their families are welcome to visit the campus any time the university is in session. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions is open Monday-Friday from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and on many Saturdays from 8:30 a.m. to noon. Admission information sessions and student-led walking tours are offered regularly; reservations should be made in the \u2018Visit Virginia Tech\u2019 section at https://vt.edu/admissions for up- to-date schedule information.

Official online application and application fee (non-refundable): $60 for freshmen, transfer, and non- degree students; $70 for international students. Please note: we expect students to apply online at https://vt.edu/admissions. 2. Applicants are required to submit self-reported grades and test scores through the online application process. 3. A final official transcript is requested after admission is offered and the student accepts the offer. 4. Discharge certificate (DD214) if the applicant is a veteran. 5. Domicile supporting documents if the student is requesting in-state status. An Early Decision Option is available for students with strong qualifications who are committed to attend Virginia Tech. Those interested in Early Decision must choose that option on the application form and submit all required credentials by November 1. All Early Decision applicants are notified of their admission status by December 15. Early Decision applicants may be offered admission, deferred to the regular applicant pool, or denied admission. Applicants deferred to the regular decision pool will receive unbiased consideration during this admission process. Early Decision is a binding agreement in which applicants agree to apply only to Virginia Tech under an Early Decision option and, if offered admission, submit the matriculation deposit by January 15. This does not mean that Early Decision applicants cannot apply to other institutions as regular-decision applicants, but rather that Virginia Tech is their first choice and, if offered admission under Early Decision, they will withdraw applications to other institutions, and accept the Virginia Tech offer. An Early Action option is available to applicants starting Fall 2018. This offering is designed for students who seek an early admissions decision that is not binding. The deadline for Early Action application is December 1. Notification of admissions decision for this group is by February 22. The applicant will have until the National deadline of May 1 to notify Virginia Tech of their decision to accept or decline their admission offer. Freshman applicants applying for Regular Decision must submit a completed application by January 15 and will receive a notification of the admission decision by March 5. If offered admission, the applicant will receive an official offer letter, instructions to apply online for housing, and instructions to download the state-required health history form. Virginia Tech subscribes to the National Candidate's Reply Date of May 1 for freshmen offered admission for the fall semester. Admission (International Applicants) International applicants for undergraduate admission are generally considered out-of-state students for tuition purposes and should apply using the Application for International Admission. International student applicants must complete the following courses: 3 units of math (includes algebra, geometry, and algebra II), 2 units of laboratory science (choose from biology, chemistry, or physics), and additional academic units (foreign language is highly recommended). International freshman applicants are not required to submit SAT or ACT scores. In addition, international students whose native language is not English must document proficiency in the English language by submitting a TOEFL (Test of English as a Foreign Language) score or IELTS (International English Language Testing System) score. Official copies of all scores must be submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. The TOEFL or IELTS is required of all applicants who are not native speakers of English, in addition to all foreign students with visas, except those raised or schooled in Australia, Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Jamaica, or other countries in which English is the language of instruction. A TOEFL score of at least 80 (with no subscore below 20) on the Internet-based test is expected. Students taking the IELTS are expected to obtain a score of at least 6.5 to be considered for admission to Virginia Tech. Achieving these scores is no guarantee of admission. Transfer applicants who have completed two semesters or terms of a non-ESL English composition course with above-average grades at an accredited U.S.-based college or university are not required to submit TOEFL or IELTS scores.< Non-English transcripts and documents must be submitted in their original form, accompanied by a certified English translation. Unofficial documents and documents without accompanying English translations will not be accepted. All university-level work completed outside the United States must be evaluated by a professional educational credential evaluation service. (A listing of credential evaluators is linked on the online international application.) No financial aid is available for international students at the undergraduate level. All undergraduate international applicants must certify that they have sufficient funds to pay for their education at Virginia Tech prior to being issued an I-20 or IAP-66. All international students holding F-1 and J-1 visas must purchase health and accident insurance. The Cranwell International Center provides a full range of services to international students at Virginia Tech. Such services include an orientation program especially designed to meet the needs of new international students, as well as immigration counseling and counseling for personal and financial problems. The center also coordinates a variety of cross-cultural programs designed to facilitate interaction between American and international students. Admission (Non-Degree-Seeking Students)Virginia Tech makes every effort to provide educational opportunities to individuals who are not seeking a degree from the university, but who wish to continue their education by taking courses at Virginia Tech for college credit or, in some cases, degree credit. Such students include, but are not limited to, students enrolled in other colleges or universities and senior citizens. Non-degree applicants must be in good standing from all previously attended educational institutions with no serious disciplinary infractions. Students will not be competitive for admission if their most recent work is below a 2.0 or their cumulative GPA is below a 2.0. Students who enroll at Virginia Tech under this program may not be considered candidates for degrees unless they apply formally for regular undergraduate or graduate admission. At that time, minimum requirements must be met and the applicant's academic and disciplinary record at Virginia Tech and all other colleges and universities attended would be reviewed within the context of the current competition for regular admission. Applying as a Non-Degree-Seeking Student When applying as a non-degree-seeking student, the applicant must send the following materials to the admissions office: Official online application for admission as a non-degree-seeking student, plus a $60 application fee (non-refundable). A letter explaining the purpose of attending Virginia Tech as a non-degree-seeking student. In some cases, the Admissions Committee may request an interview. Unofficial transcripts from all colleges and/or universities attended. Non-degree seeking students may apply online at https://vt.edu/admissions. The application should be submitted by the published deadline for the term selected (April 15 for Summer Session I, June 1 for Summer Session II, August 1 for Fall). If accepted, the applicant will receive an official notice of admission via e-mail along with other related forms. Restrictions on Non-Degree-Seeking Students Students who have been denied admission to Virginia Tech as freshmen or transfer students for the same term will not be eligible for reconsideration as non-degree-seeking students. Non-degree-seeking students will be able to register on a space-available basis only. Until the deadline for adding classes, such students may be required to drop a class if the number of degree-seeking students exceeds the number of available spaces in a particular class. Non-degree-seeking students will be permitted to attempt up to 30 hours at Virginia Tech, not to exceed 11 hours in any one term during the academic year or 5 hours in either summer school term. Non-degree-seeking students are required to maintain an overall GPA of at least 2.0 for continued enrollment. Non-degree-seeking students are not eligible for financial aid, scholarships or on-campus housing. Students who have previously been enrolled at Virginia Tech may not reapply as non-degree-seeking students. Former students who left the university in good standing may register for classes through Hokie SPA (http://www.hokiespa.vt.edu). Admission (Transfer Process) Admission is offered on a competitive basis to transfer applicants with the strongest academic records and with completed courses needed in their intended major. Competitive applicants will achieve mostly Bs or better. In majors where applications exceed available space, the competitive grades will be considerably higher. Architecture and industrial design are not available for transfer applicants. The most important factors considered for admission are: completion or substantial progress toward completing prerequisite courses -- particularly freshman English, math and science appropriate for the intended major; and overall GPA in college course work. Applicants from accredited colleges and universities, including applicants from Virginia community collegeswho have completed two full academic years and have received an associate's degree in the University Parallel College/Transfer Program, must (1) have completed all entrance requirements, or their equivalents, in their college developmental program; (2) have a minimum GPA of 2.5 on a 4.0 scale in all previous college work attempted; and (3) be in good standing with all colleges or universities attended. The applicant's overall grade point average and the quality of the student's former academic program are critical factors in admissions considerations. Most transfer applicants who are offered admission have a minimum GPA of 3.0 (on a 4.0 scale). Prospective applicants from the Virginia Community College System will find information about guaranteed admissions agreements at https://vt.edu/admissions/transfer/vccs.html. Transfer applicants must send the following application materials to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions: Official online application and application fee (non-refundable): $60 for freshmen, transfer, and non- degree students; $70 for international students. Please note: we expect students to apply online at https://vt.edu/admissions. Applicants are required to submit self-reported grades and test scores through the online application process. A final official transcript is requested after admission is offered and the student accepts the offer. Discharge certificate (DD214) if the applicant is a veteran. Domicile supporting documents if the student is requesting in-state status. Completed applications are considered and decisions are made by the Admissions Committee. If offered admission, the applicant will receive an official notice of admission and related forms. Transfer applications for summer/fall admission are due January 15, and will receive notification of the admissions decision by March 5. Students offered admission must respond to the offer by June 1. If space is available, transfer applications for spring admission are due October 1, decisions are mailed by November 15, and responses are due December 15. Advanced Placement Through Advanced Placement examinations administered in May of each year by the College Entrance Examination Board, students receiving required scores may be considered for Advanced Placement credit in certain subjects in which they show proficiency. Final determination of credit will be made after the test results have been evaluated by the university. Students must have scores sent directly to the Office of the University Registrar at Virginia Tech (school code 5859) from the College Entrance Examination Board. If scores were not directed to the University Registrar at the time of the examination, contact the College Board at (888) 308- 0013. Credits allowed for advanced placement are shown as transfer hours on Hokie SPA. These credits, not to exceed 38 semester hours, are counted as hours passed when considering academic eligibility. Refer to the Office of the University Registrar\u2019s website at http://www.registrar.vt.edu/registration/transfer/ap-ib-clep- credit.html for information and to view the AP Credit Table. Questions about Advanced Placement credit should be directed to the Office of the University Registrar at registrar@vt.edu. Advanced Standing Advanced standing refers to an arrangement that permits a student to be placed in a course without having completed the normal prerequisites. Credit may be awarded for English and/or Math courses based upon grades achieved in specific validating courses. Advanced standing without credit will be allowed for satisfactory completion of one to five years of study in a foreign language in a secondary school. Advanced standing with credit will be awarded for students who qualify and meet the criteria as established by university policy. The criteria for the validating courses is it must be the first attempt and a grade of \"C-\" orhigher must be earned. Credit will be awarded automatically at the completion of each semester. Applying to Graduate School Students interested in working toward an advanced degree at Virginia Tech should contact the Graduate School for an application (http://www.graduateschool.vt.edu). Undergraduate students enrolling in Graduate Programs or courses Virginia Tech offers the opportunity to outstanding undergraduate students (Seniors/Juniors) nearing the end of their bachelor\u2019s degree program to enroll and receive credit for coursework taken to apply toward a future graduate program.

Transfer Student Credentials Evaluation For new incoming students, official final academic transcripts from all colleges previously attended should be submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Courses from another institution in which a grade of \"C-\" or lower was earned, and courses taken on a pass/fail or audit basis, are not acceptable for transfer credit. Grades in transfer courses do not transfer or appear on a student\u2019s record at Virginia Tech, and are not included in a student\u2019s Virginia Tech GPA computation. Only grades of \"C\" or higher in courses consistent with those offered at Virginia Tech are certified for transfer credit. Credit will be awarded based on Virginia Tech policies. Courses for which a student received credit by exam, Advanced Placement (AP) credit, or credit for life experiences at another university are not transferable. AP, IB, Cambridge, and CLEP scores should be sent directly to the University Registrar at Virginia Tech from the testing services. Credit will not be awarded from high school transcripts or another institution's transcripts. Refer to the Office of the University Registrar\u2019s website at http://registrar.vt.edu/registration-multi-brief/ap-ib-clep-credit.html for contact information for testing services and to view the AP, IB, Cambridge, and CLEP Credit Tables. No more than 50 percent of the credits required for graduation from Virginia Tech may be transferred from two-year colleges. To receive transfer credit, official academic transcripts from all colleges previously attended should be received in the Office of the University Registrar no later than the end of the first term of the student's first enrollment at Virginia Tech. Class standing will be based upon the number of credits designatedas acceptable for meeting graduation requirements. All transfer credits are used in the computation of academic eligibility. International transfer students are required to submit additional documentation. For a list of required documentation for Admissions see http://www.admiss.vt.edu/apply/application-checklist/. The Office of the University Registrar requires documentation in addition to what is needed for Undergraduate Admissions. These credentials are needed in order for the evaluation of international transfer credit to take place. For the required information please see http://www.tranguide.registrar.vt.edu/2017/requirements.html#internationalrequirements. Transfer Policy of Virginia Community College Students Per State Policy on Transfer, students who take their entire course work (native Virginia Community College or Richard Bland students) toward the baccalaureate degree by enrolling in transfer programs at a Virginia Community College or Richard Bland College, who graduate with associate degrees (appropriate for the major) based upon a baccalaureate-oriented sequence of courses, and who are offered admission to Virginia Tech will be granted junior level status upon admission. Additionally, these students will have fulfilled the requirements of the Curriculum for Liberal Education (CLE), except for departments with specific CLE requirements. However, it may take such students longer than two years to complete the baccalaureate degree because of major prerequisites and other circumstances or requirements. Non-native students are those students who do not begin their college work at a Virginia Community College, or transfer credits to the Virginia Community College to complete the transfer associate degree. Admission preference shall be given to transfer students who have completed an A.A., A.S., or A.A.S. (Associate in Arts and Sciences) at the Virginia Community College System or Richard Bland College. While some courses from the Associate of Applied Science degree from a Virginia Community College or Richard Bland College may transfer to Virginia Tech, the Associate of Applied Science degree does not transfer. Transfer students shall have the same opportunities as other students in areas of residence and dining programs, registration, and scholarships and financial aid.

This catalog presents the offerings and requirements in effect at time of publication, but in no way guarantees that they will not be changed or revoked. The regulations and policies may change to meet new needs or as legislation is approved. Such changes are published in the President's Policy Memoranda. The policies and regulations that appear in this catalog are not meant to form a contract or to constitute an offer of one. Current information may be obtained from the following: Undergraduate Admission Requirements: Director of Admissions. Course Offerings: Academic departments offering the course(s) in question. Degree Requirements: Office of the University Registrar, head of major department, or academic dean of the college. Fees and Tuition: Office of the University Bursar. Course Numbering System The first digit in course number designations denotes the year in which the course ordinarily is found in the curricular outlines or \"checksheets,\" which are available from the major department or academic advisor. The second and third digits make the course number unique within a department. The fourth digit is 4 if the course is a one-term terminal course, 5 if the course is the first term in a sequence, and 6 if the second term in a sequence. As a general rule, courses with 0 as the first digit do not carry university credit. Agricultural Technology courses, however, are an exception. Cross Listed Courses Courses that are cross listed between departments may not be counted twice toward meeting graduation requirements. No credit will be allowed for a course taken that duplicates subject matter in a course for which credit already has been received. Cross listed courses are indicated in the title line of course descriptions; forinstance, REL 3454 is listed as follows: 3454 (PHIL 3454): PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION The first number is the Religion course number, while the number in parentheses indicates that the course is cross listed with Philosophy. Graduate Course Listings Information regarding graduate courses (5000 and above) may be found in the Graduate Catalog. Prerequisite Notations and Requirements Students are permitted to take courses without having the specified prerequisites only upon obtaining the consent of the instructor. Students who enroll in a course for which they have not clearly satisfied the prerequisites or equivalent, or obtained the appropriate permission, may be dropped from the course. Deliberately false statements testifying to the satisfaction of prerequisites constitute a violation of the honor code. Students have the right to appeal a decision about prerequisites to the head of the department offering a course. Students should recognize that 3000 and 4000 level courses assume a certain level of academic maturity and general background regardless of the stated prerequisites. The course instructor can be consulted regarding the implications of this expectation for a specific course. Students must consult with the instructor if they wish to use the Pass/Fail option in a course for which they do not have the prerequisites. Students should note prerequisite and corequisite requirements as stated in the course descriptions. Courses in a series may be taken independently where the series of course numbers is separated by commas (e.g., 3135, 3136), in the catalog listing. Where the series of course numbers is connected by hyphens (e.g., 4135- 4136), the first course is prerequisite for the next one. Tables The numbers on the right hand side of tables listed under certain departments denote the number of hours the class meets each week during the term and, in parentheses, the number of credits allowed for the course. A listing such as 3(3) means that the course meets three hours each week and three credits are earned. University Course Series (UNIV) University Course Series are courses sponsored to enhance the undergraduate academic experience. The courses may not count toward degree credit. Check with your advisor or academic dean to verify degree applicability. Undergraduate Course Descriptions (UNIV) 1004: COLLEGE SUCCESS STRATEGIES Study and application of strategies, skills, attitudes and behaviors leading to effective academic learning in a college setting.

Undergraduate students currently approved for participation in an Academic Common Market (ACM) major may continue to receive benefits as long as they are continuously enrolled full time in the ACM approved major (not to exceed six (6) years following this discontinuance), maintain a 2.0 overall grade point average, and satisfactory progress toward the degree. AuditingStudents are assessed the same rate for tuition and fees for auditing courses as for courses taken for credit. Billing Statements (E-Bill) Student Accounts are billed electronically. Current e-bills, e-bill history, and real-time current account activity are viewed in the e-billing system accessed through the student portal (Hokie SPA). E-bills are posted at least monthly, on the 15th (if the 15th of the month occurs on a weekend, e-bills are posted on the Friday before the 15th). Payment is required by due date on the statement to avoid penalties such as a late fee, registration hold, and cancellation of registration. The initial e-bill for fall semester 2017 will be posted July 14, 2017 and will be due August 10, 2017. Charges for new activity after July 14 and payments made to date will be e-billed on August 15, and again on September 2, 2017. All charges billed between July 14 and September 2, 2017 must be paid by midnight September 11, 2017 or classes may be dropped for non-payment. The initial e-bill for spring semester 2018 will be processed in December 2017. A schedule similar to the fall e- bill schedule is followed. All charges for the fall and spring semesters must be paid by the close of the 10th class day, one week following the last day to add classes each semester, or classes may be dropped for non- payment. E-bills for the summer and winter terms will be posted at least one month prior to the start of each term. Past due charges will prevent access to drop add and prevent pre-registration for the upcoming semester. Finance charges are incurred for past due charges from a prior semester. Budget Tuition Plan Virginia Tech's Budget Tuition Plan (BTP) offers a convenient method for planning and budgeting payment of tuition, fees, room, and board. The BTP can cover all or part of the semester institutional charges. This plan provides the opportunity for the student to enroll and remit payments. The only cost for this service is a non- refundable application fee that is due with the application each semester. Students can join the BTP online through Hokie SPA. Visit www.bursar.vt.edu for additional information and online tutorials. Bursar The Office of the University Bursar is responsible for the billing of tuition, fees, housing, dining plans and many other student and related charges. Billing statements are electronically generated monthly for new account activity and any previous balance. The e-bill can be viewed on the student portal Hokie SPA and payment can be made by e-check or by credit card. Payment can also be made by mail or in person at the Bursar Office in 150 Student Services Building. Students may authorize parents or others as payers on their e-bill account. Unless revoked by the student, the authorized payer receives the e-bill notification monthly and is able to view the account and make payments electronically to the student's account. Release of Financial Information to a third party such as parent(s) and/or guardian(s) requires student authorization under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA). The FERPA disclosure can be done via the Hokie SPA. Detailed information regarding tuition and fees, payment deadlines, customer service window hours, the Budget Tuition Plan, electronic billing and payment processes, and much more are available on the Bursar's website www.bursar.vt.edu. Collection of Past Due Receivables for Students Any amount owed to the university including, but not limited to, tuition, fees, room, board, loans, notesreceivable, and amounts due for goods and services provided is considered a receivable to the university. A receivable becomes past due if payment is not received by the payment due date. At ninety days past due, the receivable becomes delinquent. For currently enrolled students, the primary collection tool is the placement of a \"HOLD\" by the Office of the University Bursar on a student's record. This \"HOLD\" restricts certain student activities such as the ability to add or drop classes, receive grade transcripts, register for future academic terms, and may also result in a hold on your diploma if you are a candidate for graduation. Once established, the \"HOLD\" remains in place until the debt is paid in full. When a student is no longer enrolled, the collection procedures utilized for other \"non-student\" receivables are implemented. Individuals are responsible to pay all fees and charges owed to Virginia Tech. If the individual defaults on payment, has a returned check, e-check, or debit of said fees and charges, or has any delinquent amount owed, the individual must pay a penalty fee, interest at the highest rate allowed by law or as agreed to with Virginia Tech, and all reasonable administrative costs, collections fees, and attorney's fees incurred in the collection of amounts due the university. Students will be notified by an email sent to their Virginia Tech email address to alert them that a statement has been generated. Virginia Tech and their respective agents or contractors may contact individuals regarding any amounts owed, at the current or any future number provided for the cellular phone or other wireless device using automated telephone dialing equipment or artificial or pre- recorded voice or text messages. Addresses must be kept current and can be changed by students as needed on Hokie SPA. Non-receipt of e- bill notification is not a valid defense for non-payment; it is the responsibility of the individual who has incurred the debt to see that the debt is discharged. For non-students, a dunning message is included on each month's statement alerting the customer to the next collection steps that will be taken. If payment is not forthcoming within the stated period, the account and all pertinent information are forwarded to an outside collection agency for further collection efforts. In addition, the account is reported to national credit bureaus, thus affecting the debtor's credit rating. In addition to the above measures, the university also lists the account with the Virginia Department of Taxation for set-off debt collection procedures. This means that any state income tax refund or payment processed through the State Treasurer's Office to the debtor will be reduced by the amount of the receivable owed by the debtor.

Honor Code and Honor System The Honor Code is the university policy which defines the expected standards of conduct in academic affairs. The Virginia Tech Honor Code embodies a spirit of mutual trust and intellectual honesty that is central to the very nature of the university and represents the highest possible expression of shared values among the members of the university community. The fundamental beliefs underlying and reflected in the Honor Code are: that trust in a person is a positive force in making that person worthy of trust, that every student has the right to live in an academic environment that is free from the injustices caused by any form of intellectual dishonesty, and that the honesty and integrity of all members of the university community contribute to its quest for truth. The functions of the Honor System are to communicate the meaning and importance of intellectual honesty to all students of the university; to articulate and support the interest of the community in maintaining the highest standards of conduct in academic affairs; and to identify, sanction, and educate those who fail to live up to the stated expectation of the university community with regard to these standards.

To this end, the Honors College provides opportunities and challenges founded on meaningful and sustained relationships with faculty, independent learning, undergraduate research, place-based and problem-focused experiences, and intellectual engagement in global contexts. Our requirements are designed to maximize the disciplinary depth, transdisciplinary capabilities, and purpose-driven engagement that are the hallmarks of the VT-Shaped student experience. Admissions The freshman and transfer applications to Virginia Tech automatically include consideration for admission to the Honors College and consideration for any relevant Honors College recruitment scholarships. The Honors College does not consider minimum test scores. We look holistically at an applicant's experiences and consider the quality of engagement over sheer quantity, self-awareness and reflection on involvement, and authenticity. Transfer students must have a cumulative GPA of 3.60 or better at their previous institution. Currently enrolled Virginia Tech students will receive an invitation to apply to the Honors College at the end of each fall or spring semester provided they have achieved a 3.60 or better cumulative GPA and have at least four (4) semesters remaining at Virginia Tech before they graduate. Honors Laureate Diploma Virginia Tech Honors College students work toward an Honors Laureate Diploma. This diploma offers two options: the first is self-directed by the student, the second maintains that flexibility, but focuses the honors credit options around a particular curricular area established in advance by the Honors College in collaboration with disciplinary departments. The Four Elements of an Honors Education are the foundation of an Honors Laureate Diploma. The Elements are Honors College Curriculum, Disciplinary Depth, Transdisciplinary Capabilities, and Undergraduate Research & Guided Experiential Learning. Students are required to earn at least six honors credits in elements two, three, and four. Upon graduation, students are required to complete no less than thirty total credits in the four elements. Visit our website at http://www.honorscollege.vt.edu for more information.An honors diploma appears on the Virginia Tech diploma as a special designation and is not a separate document. Honors Academic Requirements The Course of Study Planner & GPA The Course of Study Planner (COSP) To demonstrate potential to earn an Honors Laureate Diploma, the Honors College expects that students receive approval on their COSP by the end of their first semester in Honors. GPA To demonstrate that students can meet the level of academic achievement we expect in Honors, students are required to achieve a 3.60 or better cumulative GPA after two traditional semesters in Honors. A 3.6 or better cumulative GPA from the semester at Virginia Tech immediately previous to entering the Honors College may count toward this requirement. GPA Flex Period Once students accomplish the above goals, they may enter the GPA Flex Period. The GPA Flex Period is a time in which the Honors College no longer monitors GPA. This gives students the freedom to take academic risks that can become some of their most educational experiences. Graduation Requirement Students in the GPA Flex Period must achieve a cumulative 3.30 or better GPA and complete honors diploma requirements. (Students who never receive COSP approval and never enter the GPA Flex Period are required to maintain a 3.60 cumulative GPA after every semester until the planner is approved or upon graduation.) Honors Diploma Progress Complete at least thirty honors credits. Elements Two, Three, and Four each require at least six honors credits. Earn honors credit at least once every twelve months and complete the yearly Progress Survey. Grading Scale Take courses as A\u2013F unless P/F is the only option. Honors Advising A primary function of the Honors College is to support student efforts to individualize their education through a self-designed honors diploma that complements their departmental degree(s). Students can find support in the Honors Peer Advising Center and with the honors staff. The Honors Peer Advising Center enables honors students to meet individually with trained Honors Peer Advisors to talk through processes and resources to solve Honors-related problems. The Honors Peer Advising Center also offers small-group workshops on topics of broad interest to honors students. The Honors Peer Advising Center enables honors students to meet individually with trained Honors Peer Advisors to talk through processes and resources to solve Honors-related problems. The Honors Peer Advising Center also offers small-group workshops on topics of broad interest to honors students. The honors staff also welcomes student appointments and walk-in visits. Each staff member has a distinct specialization with which they can assist students. Furthermore, advising for major national scholarships, such as Rhodes and Marshall, is available through the Honors College for all Virginia Tech students.Honors Residential Communities Honors College students have two Honors residential community options: the Hillcrest Community of about 100 students in Hillcrest Hall and the Honors Residential Commons of about 320 students in East Ambler Johnston Hall. Both communities are multigenerational and multidisciplinary, housing first-year students to fifth-year seniors from all seven colleges at Virginia Tech. Honors students are not required to live in an Honors residential community. Many students live off-campus or in other living-learning communities or residence halls.

Sano- Franchini Phone: 540-231-8440University Academic Advising Center The University Academic Advising Center serves the university community in several ways. First, it administers the University Studies and Explore Technology programs for new undergraduate students who want to explore a variety of degree programs before they commit to one particular major. Students who enter Virginia Tech as University Studies or Explore Technology are not limited to pursuing a specific major in their first year. With the guidance of a professional academic advisor, students research the full range of degree programs related to their interests and design programs of study that meet graduation requirements while providing the academic flexibility to pursue whichever degree program they ultimately choose. Second, the Advising Center assists new students who intend to reapply to competitive admission majors. Advisors work with these students in developing programs of study that meet the established criteria for admission into their chosen major. For both of these student populations, the University Academic Advising Center serves as both the college and department, providing administrative services, dean's office services, and academic advising until the students enter a specific major. University Studies University Studies is a major but it is not a degree-granting program. University Studies offers a structured advising program that provides students with the necessary support and strategies to investigate and compare academic disciplines so that they can make informed decisions about the degree programs they will pursue. Students can explore any major available at the university while completing course requirements toward a baccalaureate degree. To ensure that students graduate in a timely manner, University Studies requires all students to enter a specific degree program by the time they have earned 60 credits toward graduation (approximately the end of the sophomore year) or have attempted 72 hours. Explore Technology (XT) XT is a major but it is not a degree granting program. XT allows students to explore majors that are related to technology and adds technological skills to other existing majors. All students in XT will take the Exploring Technology Pathways to Success course. This course will allow you to explore different majors that fit your skills and interests while preparing you for success at Virginia Tech. The course is part of theFirst Year Experience program and, best of all, will be taught by your academic advisor. To ensure that students graduate in a timely manner, XT requires all students to enter a specific degree program by the time they have earned 60 credits toward graduation (approximately the end of the sophomore year) or have attempted 72 hours. Restricted Majors University Studies and Explore Technology students can pursue any major offered at the university; however, students should be aware that some majors are competitive for internal transfer. These programs have established specific criteria and application procedures that students must fulfill in order to be considered for internal transfer into the major. In general, these criteria require students to demonstrate proficiency in designated core courses and, for some programs, in introductory major courses before they are eligible to apply. University Studies and Explore Technology students enter and graduate from these restricted programs each year; however, since there is no guarantee of acceptance to these programs, students are encouraged to investigate alternative majors even as they prepare to enter a restricted program. Restricted Programs for Internal Transfers College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise College of Architecture and Urban Studies Architecture Art and Art History - Visual Communication (Graphic) Design; Studio Art Creative Technologies Industrial Design Interior Design Landscape Architecture Minor: Industrial Design Pamplin College of Business Accounting and Information Systems Business Information Technology Finance, Ins. & Business Law Hospitality and Tourism Management Management Marketing Minor: Business College of Engineering All majors Academic advisors in the University Academic Advising Center are familiar with the internal transfer criteria and procedures for all restricted programs and will assist students in fulfilling these requirements. Pathways to General Education All undergraduate students at the university, regardless of their majors, are required to fulfill general education course requirements in English, mathematics, science, social science, humanities, etc. There is a standard set of these courses, Pathways to General Education, which all degree programs incorporate in their graduation requirements. In general, General Education requirements are completed in the freshman and sophomore years. Some majors are flexible with regard to which General Education courses can be used to fulfill degreerequirements; other majors designate specific General Education course selections. Academic advisors assist University Studies and Explore Technology students in selecting courses that apply toward as many of the majors a student is considering as possible. Thus, students fulfill degree requirements for graduation while they are exploring majors and are usually able to graduate on time. Typical First Year Program First Semester Second Semester First-Year Writing First-Year Writing Mathematics Mathematics Natural Science (lab-if required by Natural Science (lab-if required by intended major) intended major) Social Science Social Science Humanities/Elective/Major Specific Humanities/Elective Course For University Studies and Explore Technology students, as for most students at the university, the first year is primarily devoted to fulfilling Pathways to General Education requirements. Of course, University Studies and Explore Technology students' programs of study vary depending upon the major or majors they are considering. Specific course selections are determined in individual consultation with an academic advisor. Graduation Requirements The requirements to graduate in a specific major are determined by the department and college conferring the degree. In general, students are required to have a minimum 2.0 overall grade-point average and a minimum 2.0 grade-point average in their major in order to graduate. The number of credit hours required for a baccalaureate degree varies from 120 to 136 hours, depending upon a student's major and degree program. Honors College The freshman application to Virginia Tech automatically includes consideration for admission to the Honors College and consideration for any relevant Honors College recruitment scholarships. The Honors College does not consider minimum test scores. They look holistically at an applicant's experiences and consider the quality of engagement over sheer quantity, se;f-awareness and reflection on involvement, and authenticity. A student's application to Virginia Tech automatically serves as an application to the Honors College. There is no separate deadline to be considered for the Honors College. Dean's List University Academic Advising Center students who demonstrate academic excellence are named to the Academic Dean's List and are awarded a Dean's List certificate. Students must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 graded hours (A-F) and must achieve a 3.4 GPA or higher in the fall or spring term to qualify. Pre-Professional Advising Students who want to enter professional schools but who have not yet chosen an undergraduate major will find that the university offers a variety of degree programs that provide excellent preparation for advanced training in professional fields. Though some professional programs, such as medicine, dentistry,and veterinary medicine, require students to complete a minimum number of credit hours at the undergraduate level in chemistry, biology, mathematics, etc., professional schools do not dictate that students pursue specific undergraduate majors. A student can pursue almost any undergraduate degree and be competitive for admission to a professional program. Global Education Office (Study Abroad) Opportunities to study at institutions in other countries are available to all qualified students, regardless of their major. Study abroad offers students a unique opportunity to learn about other cultures and peoples while earning college credit. Students who intend to participate in an overseas study experience should discuss their intentions with their advisor early in their academic career. \u00a9 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the University RegistrarMenu 2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and"

Engineers are needed across a broad spectrum of industry from the traditional fields such as mechanical to the emerging fields of robotics and biomedicine. Engineers must not only satisfy society's demand for improved performance, reliability and safety of products, they also are expected to supply solutions for environmental and social problems created by new technology. Our graduates are well-rounded problem solvers with learned classroom knowledge and hands-on applicable skills. Graduates with diverse perspectives trained in engineering will find many professional outlets. They may join large or small manufacturing industries or they may offer their skills and knowledge as professional consultants. They may work in government or private research laboratories or teach and do research in universities. If the future leads them into other professions such as medicine, law, food services, or business, their engineering education shall provide a sound base. Graduates of the College of Engineering are in high demand. Our Student Engineers' Council-run Engineering EXPO \u2014 Virginia Tech's largest career fair and one of the largest student-run career fairs in the nation \u2014 brought in approximately 291 employers in 2016. The Virginia Tech College of Engineering is a key recruiting school for major national corporations and government agencies. It is essential that engineers, regardless of specialty, be well-versed in mathematics, the physical sciences and the engineering sciences so that they can adapt readily to meet the profession's ever- changing demands. But professional training is not enough. Engineers need to have passion, imagination, and insight. They must understand the history and traditions of the society in which they live. They also must be familiar with the social sciences and humanities. Engineers also must be able to communicate effectively with higher management and the general public. All departments within the college have programs to ensure that every graduate is able to effectively use a variety of spoken, visual, and written communication strategies, which are necessary for success as a student, for employment, and for life as a responsible citizen. Additionally, freshmen engineering classes emphasize the importance of communications in engineering analysis and design. Engineers who are well-educated, not just well-trained, will be better equipped to develop scientific knowledge into useful technology.

The building was named after alum Bill Goodwin and his wife, Alice, in fall 2014. The Goodwins donated $25 million to the construction of the building, a university record for a personal donation. Goodwin graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1962. The College of Engineering-led Institute for Critical Technology and Applied Science (ICTAS) is now housed in the Hugh and Ethel Kelly Building on campus, dedicated in the fall semester of 2013. Ethel Kelly's estate provided $5 million to help cover the cost of the most recent of three buildings built for the institute. That building opened in 2011 and is on Washington Street. What is now Kelly Hall opened in 2009 and is on Stanger Street. Another $1 million from the estate will support the new ICTAS Hugh and Ethel Kelly Lecture Series. Hugh Kelly, who died in 1989, earned his bachelor's and master's degrees of electrical engineering in 1937 and in 1938, worked at AT&T's Bell Laboratories, and played important roles in groundbreaking projects, including the 1962 launch of the Telstar communications satellite, the first private venture in space. Ethel Kelly, who died in 2012, generously supported Virginia Tech's College of Engineering as a way of honoring her husband's legacy. Hugh and Ethel Kelly were early members of the Committee of 100. They later joined the Ut Prosim and the Legacy Societies. Hugh was a member of the College of Engineering's Academy of Engineering Excellence.

An Aerobiology Building in support of an agriculture/life science and engineering is planned for Kentland Farm, located off campus and heading roughly due west on Prices Fork Road. The facility will facilitate the research of unmanned aerial vehicles used to combat the spread of crop and animal diseases. Green Engineering Virginia Tech was one of the first universities to formally consider the connection between engineering practice and environmental stewardship from an interdisciplinary perspective. The Green Engineering Program was created in 1995 and serves all departments within the College of Engineering. This program combines environmentally conscious attitudes, values and principles with science, technology, and engineering practice, and focuses this interdisciplinary approach toward improving local and global environmental quality. Based on engineering fundamentals, green engineering analyzes the design of products, processes, and systems to minimize the life cycle environmental impacts, from the initial extraction of raw materials to the energy consumption and waste production during manufacturing to the ultimate disposal of materials that cannot be reused or recycled. The Green Engineering Program works with students, faculty and the university administration to provide educational and research opportunities with regard to both the environmental impacts and the environmental solutions that can result from engineering practice. A university-recognized minor allows students to pursue their interests in Green Engineering in addition to their primary degree(s) in the College of Engineering. To obtain this minor, students are required to take 18 credit hours in the minor area as follows: six (6) credits in the two core courses \u2013 Introduction to Green Engineering and Environmental Life Cycle Analysis; six (6) credits in interdisciplinary elective courses; and six (6) credits in disciplinary electives within the students' major. Detailed lists of the courses which meet the minor requirements can be found in the Green Engineering Web site at www.eng.vt.edu/green. Examples of Accomplishments at the National Level Over the past two years, Marc Edwards, professor of civil and environmental engineering, and his team of students and research scientists uncovered widespread lead-in-water contamination in Flint, Michigan. The team collected samples from locations across Flint and found extremely high levels of lead and other contaminants in the city's drinking water. In March 2016, the Virginia Tech team of students returned to Flint on spring break, working alongside citizen volunteers in Flint collecting water samples for another round of lead testing. Results from the second round of testing showed Flint water is still not safe to drink, but should continue to be used, flushing lead from the system and allowing it to heal. Edwards, a leading expert in safe drinking water and the deterioration of the water delivery infrastructure in America's largest cities, has worked to seek solutions to the crisis. He serves on Michigan Gov. Snyder's advisory group and has testified multiple times before Congress on the crisis. Edwards was named on Time's top 100 list of influential world leaders in 2016. The Hyperloop at Virginia Tech team scored big in Texas during design weekend and in the first competition round in California with two fourth place finishes and a Technical Excellence Award against more than 120 teams representing many of the top universities in the world. The Hyperloop competition pitted teams designing systems for the Hyperloop transportation system, a project initiated by SpaceX and Tesla founder Elon Musk. The Hyperloop is a high-speed transportation system using a near- vacuum tube to propel a passenger-carrying pod at speeds potentially in excess of 700 miles per hour. The Virginia Tech team's design incorporates magnets not only to levitate the pod, but also to provide braking power. The team will be one of more than 20 that move on to build a prototype to be tested at a1.5 kilometer test track facility in California for the third round of the pod competition. Under Barack Obama's administration, the Next Generation Power Electronics Manufacturing Innovation Institute was created. North Carolina State University is leading this effort with a major engagement from Virginia Tech's Center for Power Electronic Systems (CPES). Over 25 other organizations will participate in this research effort on wide band-gap semiconductor power electronics. The research is funded at $140 million over five years, with half from the Department of Energy and half from the participating organizations. Members of the electrical and computer engineering department will work on this initiative. More can be found here: http://energy.gov/articles/factsheet-next-generation-power-electronics- manufacturing-innovation-institute. The Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics (ESM) and the Department of Biomedical Engineering (a.k.a. the School of Biomedical Engineering and Science, SBES) merged in 2014, creating the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics (BEAM). The Virginia Tech-India ICTAS Innovation Center, located in Swarnabhoomi, which is south of Chennai in Tamil Nadu, focuses on energy harvesting, with much of this research conducted through the mechanical engineering department. Through its University Technology Centers (UTC), Rolls-Royce has built a network for research and graduate education with 24 universities around the world. Building upon Virginia Tech's successful partnering on the Commonwealth Center for Aerospace Propulsions Systems (CCAPS) and the Commonwealth Center for Advanced Manufacturing (CCAM), Rolls-Royce awarded UTC standing for Virginia Tech and the University of Virginia. Virginia Tech was handpicked to participate in a $30 million national effort sponsored by the National Collegiate Athletic Association and the U.S. Department of Defense to combat concussions among college athletes and active service military personnel. The initiative has been called the most comprehensive study of concussion and head impact exposure ever conducted, with 25,000 male and female NCAA student-athletes participating in the study. Virginia Tech is focusing on football, women's soccer, men's soccer, and women's lacrosse. Data collected from athletes will be used to help curb head injuries among U.S. Armed Forces personnel. The study was launched by the White House. Serving as principal investigator is Stefan Duma, head of the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Mechanics. Also during the past year, Duma and his research team released long-awaited ranking of hockey helmets on their ability to help protect a player's head. The research \u2013 covered by national media \u2013 follows long- time work on football helmets, which Duma has focused on the youth, high school, college, and professional levels. Five months after successfully demonstrating that an adult-sized robot can locate and put out fires aboard a U.S. Navy ship, student members of the combined Terrestrial Robotics Engineering and Controls Lab (TREC) and Extreme Environments, Robotics & Materials Laboratory (ExtReMe) labs within the College of Engineering are already working on improving the self-built humanoid that has wowed the Navy. The robot is named SAFFiR - short for Shipboard Autonomous Firefighting Robot - and it was fabricated in Goodwin Hall's Wendy and Norris E. Mitchell '58 Robotics Laboratory. It stands 5 foot, 10 inches tall and weighs about 140 pounds. SAFFIR is part of a new program by the U.S. Office of Navy Research to create new, high-tech tools for sailors to fight fires aboard ships where dangers are manyfold. ONR already has spent $4.5 million on the Virginia Tech project and will increase funding as new, improved incarnations of the robot are built. SAFFiR will gain keener intelligence and visual recognition cues and stronger, more versatile legs along with plating to protect him from heat, soot, and water. \"It's not going to replace Navy firefighters, it's going to assist Navy firefighters,\" said TREC member Viktor Orekhov. SAFFiR wowed crowds at the worldwide DARPA Robotics Challenge in Los Angeles, California by walking roughly 200 feet untethered along a loose dirt path onto pavement.

Vemulapalli Web: www.vetmed.vt.edu Overview Founded by the Virginia General Assembly in 1978, the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine is a regional school for the professional training of veterinarians which has been built upon the strong foundations of two of the nation's leading land-grant universities: Virginia Tech in Blacksburg and the University of Maryland at College Park. The College operates three campuses, including the main campus facilities at Virginia Tech, the Avrum Gudelsky Veterinary Center at College Park, and the Marion duPont Scott Equine Medical Center in Leesburg.Graduate Programs The graduate program leads to the M.S. and Ph.D. in biomedical and veterinary sciences. The goal of this program is to enhance the research capabilities of the graduates so that they can conduct independent research and associated societal endeavors aimed at solving biomedical problems related to veterinary medicine. These individuals will be expected to make scientific contributions in academia, research, and animal health administration. For additional information, contact the Graduate School via e-mail at vmsgrad@vt.edu. Professional Program Students desiring admission to the four-year instructional program leading to the D.V.M. degree must show evidence of intellectual ability and achievement, as well as personal preparation for the curriculum and the profession. Because the number of applicants greatly exceeds the number of spaces in entering classes, only those who demonstrate such qualifications to a high degree will be selected. Most entering students will have completed three or more years at an accredited university by the time of matriculation; however, applications will be accepted from students who have completed at least 60 semester hours or 90 quarter hours of university credit by the end of the spring term of the year for which application is being made, and who have a grade point average of at least 2.8 on a four-point scale. Exceptional students with the minimum university course work are encouraged to apply. A number of college courses, with laboratory classes, are required for entry into the DVM program including biological sciences, organic chemistry, and physics. An 8-semester-hour or 12-quarter-hour sequence is required for each of these subjects. A one-semester course (3 semester hours) in biochemistry will meet the minimum requirement for entry. Further courses required include 6 semester hours or 9 quarter hours of college-level courses in English, mathematics, and humanities/social sciences. In addition, many courses contributing to a well-rounded liberal education are of direct value and, although proficiency in the sciences is essential to the understanding of veterinary medicine, concentration on the sciences at the undergraduate level is not essential. Those students who elect to major in disciplines other than the biological sciences, chemistry, or physics may find less difficulty in coping with the basic sciences in veterinary medical school if they have, in addition to the above mentioned required courses, some work in either advanced biology or advanced chemistry. Suggested electives include: medical terminology, biostatistics; cell biology, comparative anatomy, genetics, microbiology, nutrition, physiology, or domestic animal production courses. Since veterinary medicine also is concerned with a variety of social, environmental, and community activities, a broad cultural background is important. Basic computer skills are highly desirable. Admissions inquiries should be directed to: Jacque Pelzer, D.V.M.

The Master of Public Health professional degree program integrates and expands public health offerings at Virginia Tech and enhances the university's track record of addressing vital public health issues through learning, discovery, and engagement. The program is grounded in an interdisciplinary \"One Health\" approach. One Health recognizes the dynamic interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health and encompasses the interdisciplinary efforts of medical, veterinary, environmental health, and public health professionals to protect, promote, and improve health. Students gain the requisite knowledge and skills to examine the human, animal, and environmental factors that contribute to the control and prevention of disease and the promotion, enhancement, and maintenance of health. For additional information, please contact the Public Health Program at phs@vt.edu or by phone at (540) 231-3945.

Maher (231-6591) Web: www.acis.pamplin.vt.eduOur Mission The Department of Accounting and Information Systems in the Pamplin College of Business strives for excellence in fulfilling the three missions of a comprehensive land grant university by: Improving the accounting and information systems professions by conducting quality research and disseminating the results; Providing a world class accounting and information systems education to our students; and Delivering outreach services to accounting and information systems professionals and educators. The department seeks to fulfill the teaching mission through programs which include: Undergraduate Programs, where we seek to Prepare students to enter the accounting and information systems professions with the skills and knowledge of business, information systems, and accounting concepts and practices. Masters of Accounting and Information Systems, where we seek to Prepare students for professional careers with specializations in taxation, information systems, audit, and financial services. Ph.D. Program in Business with a major in Accounting and Information Systems, where we seek to Prepare students for academic careers in research and teaching. The Department of Accounting and Information Systems prepares students to become professionals in their chosen area of accounting and information systems. Faculty members in the department have chosen to specialize in selected areas of accounting or information systems and they teach and conduct research in these areas. All faculty members at the professorial ranks have Ph.D.s in accounting or information systems appropriate to the courses they teach, and many have professional certification in their areas of specialization. This faculty is committed to the education of accounting and information systems professionals who will be active participants in this information age, with increasing demand for data analytics skills. The department's undergraduate program offers two options: Accounting (ACCT) and Information Systems Audit (ISA). These options are designed to allow students to specialize in their area of interest.Completion of the selected option prepares the student for entry level positions as professional accountants or information systems professionals who work in professional service firms, industrial companies, governmental entities, or to continue their education in graduate school. The job titles vary greatly and include auditor, information systems auditor, management accountant, tax preparer, systems consultant, systems analyst, controller, financial data analytics specialist, and cost analyst. The demand for our graduates has been strong throughout the department's history, and that demand is continuing. Many graduates of our department desire to gain certification in their selected area of specialization. The Certified Public Accountant (CPA) is the best known of these certifications. Students taking the CPA exam in Virginia have to meet a 120-hour baccalaureate or higher degree requirement in order to sit for the CPA exam, but must have 150 credit hours to be certified. The requirements for other states vary; however, most require students to meet the 150-hour educational requirement to be licensed. Students should discuss with their advisor the several options Virginia Tech provides for meeting this requirement at both the undergraduate and graduate level. In addition to the CPA exam, graduates of our programs sit for the Certificate in Management Accounting (CMA) exam, the Certified Internal Auditor (CIA) exam, the Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA) exam, and others. Students planning to take one of these exams are advised to talk to their department's faculty during their junior year so that they may select the electives appropriate for the selected exam. The department encourages its students to gain \"real world\" experience prior to graduation through an internship or by participating in the Cooperative Education Program. More information about these programs is available either from the department's faculty or Career Services. The department supports winter internships for seniors who enroll in the 152-hour program. The department also encourages interaction with accounting and information systems professionals by sponsoring three student organizations: Accounting Society; National Association of Black Accountants; and Beta Alpha Psi, the national honorary and professional society dedicated to the advancement of the accounting profession. These organizations and other campus groups provide multiple opportunities for developing leadership skills and interacting with accounting and information systems professionals. The department encourages students to gain a global perspective of business through modules on international issues in our courses, by participation in the college's International Business Minor and/or by participating in one or more of the college's study abroad programs. Our goal is to encourage our students to become well-rounded professionals who will become leaders in their chosen careers. Lastly, many of the department's over 7,000 alumni have generously contributed to a variety of scholarships for accounting and information systems majors. Each year the department awards over $300,000 in scholarships to our students. Course Requirements Students graduating from the Department of Accounting and Information Systems must have a minimum quality credit average (GPA) of 2.00 in upper-division (3000 and 4000 level) accounting and information systems courses (the in-major GPA) as well as an overall GPA of 2.00 for all courses taken at Virginia Tech.

They develop fundamental skills that are used to resolve problems faced by consumers in the market place and the work place. Graduates enter careers related to consumer affairs, marketing and sales, business management, and human resources. Required courses build a thorough understanding of households in the dual roles of producers and consumers that function within an international economic marketplace affected by government policy and regulation. Students study current events to track changing conditions and public policy. Additional courses develop skills for effectively processing and conveying information. A choice of controlled electives enables a student to tailor study to consumer products and promotion or consumer financial services, and counseling.

Weaver Web: www.aoe.vt.edu E-mail: aoe@vt.eduOverview The Department of Aerospace and Ocean Engineering offers two Bachelor of Science degree programs. Students in the department may major in either aerospace engineering or ocean engineering. Many of the course requirements for these degrees are common, because the two curricula share a broad range of common interests. Both programs offer a wide range of technical electives. Students with an interest in both majors may enroll in a double major program. The objectives of both of the department's programs include the preparation of students for entry-level positions and graduate study in the fields of aerospace engineering and ocean engineering. The department seeks to provide students with a strong background in fundamentals, including theoretical, experimental, and computational aspects of science and engineering, which will facilitate lifelong learning and the ability to pursue advanced study. It also seeks to provide students with a broad education in the aerospace and ocean vehicle fields encompassing fluid dynamics, vehicle dynamics and control, propulsion, and structures, and including an emphasis on design and synthesis in a team environment. The department's curricula are vehicle oriented, with an emphasis on aircraft and spacecraft in the aerospace program and on ships of all types in the ocean engineering program. The department's systems engineering approach to these technologies makes them increasingly applicable to other fields, such as the automobile industry, high-speed train design, and other transportation related areas. Departmental graduates find positions in these fields, as well as with the aerospace industry, NASA, the Department of Defense, the ship building industry, and maritime agencies. Employers range from large, multinational corporations to small consulting firms. Classroom studies employ modern computational techniques. Laboratory classes use the department's outstanding experimental facilities which include a large, research-quality subsonic wind tunnel with a twenty-four-foot-long, six-by-six foot cross section test area and state of the art automated control and data collection systems, a 100-foot-long towing tank, a Mach 4 supersonic wind tunnel, a Mach 7 hypersonic wind tunnel, a water tunnel, a 300-foot long asphalt runway, and several other facilities. The department encourages students to seek internships and to participate in the Cooperative Education Program, which gives qualified students valuable industrial experience while working toward their engineering degrees. The department's required design courses often include multidisciplinary projects. The Aerospace Engineering and Ocean Engineering programs are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org. The department also offers programs of study leading to M. Engr., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees. AOE students must meet all General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) requirements and only certain \"free\" electives and courses designated as \"P/F Only\" may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. Lists ofapproved electives including technical, math, Liberal Education, and other electives are available on the department's web page: www.aoe.vt.edu/undergrad/undergrad-advising/index-undergrad- advising.html.

Jones Assistant Professor Emerita: E. Braaten Web: www.archdesign.vt.eduOverview Architecture enriches our lives by offering us environments that are sensibly compelling, thought provoking, and capable of lifting our spirits. In addition to being beautiful, architecture is, by ancient definition, functional and durable. Like art, architecture is permeated by dualities. It is stable and transitory, measurable and immeasurable, and capable of both being touched and touching us. Like science, architecture involves systematic study. Its methods are iterative, experimental, and rely on intense observation. By intertwining the poetic and practical, architecture is uniquely poised to address the challenges of contemporary life and build the culture of the 21st century. The professional curriculum in architecture requires five years of study for the first professional degree, the Bachelor of Architecture (B. Arch.). The first professional degree programs at Virginia Tech, the five-year Bachelor of Architecture degree (B. Arch.), the Master of Architecture II (M.Arch.2), and the Master of Architecture III (M.Arch.3) degrees, are fully accredited for the current maximum six-year term of accreditation by the National Architectural Accrediting Board. All students in the School of Architecture + Design - Architecture, Industrial Design, Interior Design and Landscape Architecture - begin their studies in a common first year foundation program. Following the foundation program, students pursue professional studies in the 2-3 and 4-5 programs. Foundation Design Program - First Year Foundation Design Lab is an immersive, interactive learning environment focused on inquiry, experimentation, discovery, and synthesis for students studying architecture, landscape architecture, interior design, and industrial design. The design lab develops self-reliance and self-critique, opens intellectual horizons, and challenges students to continually expand and deepen their aesthetic judgment and critical understanding. Studies are undertaken in two and three dimensions across multiple scales. Professional Program - Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Years The Professional Program employs design theory and processes to study the design of buildings. Students conduct an interactive investigation of architectural space, environmental forces, and building technology. Foundations of discipline-specific knowledge are progressively introduced, discussed, and examined as they contribute to the complex totality of a work of architecture. Students explore natural and cultural forces as they relate to architecture through means of representation specific to the discipline. With architecture at the core, the program examines interdisciplinary sources such as art, science, and philosophy for the purpose of establishing the content the discipline shares with other forms of knowledge. Concepts in the Professional Program are communicated through both traditional drawings and models, as well as through modern virtual tools and digital production. All coursework seeks to develop the ability to conduct a professional written and verbal discourse. Further emphasis is placed on intellectual discipline, constructive dialogue, assertion of interest, and a self-motivated search for critical issues. The second year is characterized by an increase in the complexity of design exercises to foster a better understanding of the interplay between situation, time and desired spatial definition. Architectural constructs of smaller scales build on knowledge of basic design principles studied in the first year. The laboratory discourse focuses on principal elements of architecture and their compositional and material role in space. Architecture as the art of building is conveyed through the detailed study of exemplary built works.The third year provides for study of fundamental design principles, technical concepts and their applications, including measures of quality in architecture. The instructional content of this year articulates and communicates to students the unique nature of architecture through the study of interrelationships of material, construction systems, site, and building programs. The Architecture III design laboratory guides the student's growing experience with practical design problems and provides order to the gradual exploration and learning of the nature and means of achieving architecture. Associated with Architecture Ill are lectures, presentations, and workshops intended to challenge students toward sensible integration of necessary systems and legal responsibilities in the design and construction of buildings. The fourth year builds on the increased comprehension of building systems acquired during the third year. On-campus or off-campus, the aim of the various program options is to promote an in-depth understanding of the relationship between architectural idea and physical building form. On-campus students are offered studio courses with various focus topics. Off-campus options include several VT and non-VT Study Abroad Programs, the Extern Program, the Washington-Alexandria Center, or the Chicago Studio. Off-campus programs directed by the Virginia Tech School of Architecture + Design include: The Europe Study Abroad Fall Travel Program studies seminal European historic and contemporary architectural works and urban spaces, which are visited and documented with analytical drawings, sketches, and photographs, supplemented by on-site lectures by architects and professionals. Documented research before and after the program leads students to greater depth of understanding of the issues surrounding the architecture. The Steger Center Residency Program: Each semester, 16 architecture students take part in this program at Virginia Tech's European Steger Center for International Scholarship in Riva San Vitale, Switzerland. An 18th century villa and its gardens on the southern tip of Lake Lugano provide residence and dining facilities for Architecture + Design students, as well as 30 Virginia Tech students from other academic disciplines. Studio work, courses, research, and travel are directed to advance first-hand knowledge of the architecture, geography, and culture of Europe. The Chicago Studio: Hosted by significant architecture firms in downtown Chicago, this 4th-year off- campus semester seeks to integrate education and practice in a direct way. Its distinctive structure and curriculum is centered around urban focused studio and course work, with direct input from the profession. Site visits in the Chicago metropolitan area and the lectures and events of the active architecture culture of Chicago contribute significantly to this program. Professional Extern Program allows students to spend one semester in an approved professional setting and receive up to 12 hours of academic credit. This program provides a valuable link between the academic environment and architectural practices, discipline-related government agencies, and other design offices throughout the world. The Washington-Alexandria Architecture Center affords students from the School of Architecture + Design and from related College disciplines the opportunity to study with students and faculty from a national and international consortium of schools in the historic urban context of Old Town Alexandria. The Center complex offers studio space, classrooms, exhibition and review spaces, shops, and computer labs for the students and faculty of the consortium. The University also offers a limited number of apartments for students studying at the Center. In the fifth year, students conduct a yearlong advanced study with individual faculty advisors. The in- depth engagement with research, theory, and design is intended to broaden a student's expertise in a particular area within the field of architecture. Fifth-year students are expected to formulate and accomplish advanced high-level work in the form of a terminal project. Working with their advisors, students develop and discuss their research and design progress, and have periodic formal peer reviews throughout the year. Students are required to leave the project documentation of their 5th-year work with the school upon graduation. The first professional degree programs (B.Arch., M.Arch.2 & M.Arch.3) in architecture are accredited bythe National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). In the United States, most state registration boards require a degree from an accredited professional degree program as a prerequisite for licensure. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB), which is the sole agency authorized to accredit U.S. professional degree programs in architecture, recognizes three types of degrees: the Bachelor of Architecture, the Master of Architecture, and the Doctor of Architecture. A program may be granted a 6-year, 3-year, or 2-year term of accreditation, depending on the extent of its conformance with established educational standards. Doctor of Architecture and Master of Architecture degree programs may consist of a pre- professional undergraduate degree and a professional graduate degree that, when earned sequentially, constitute an accredited professional education. However, the pre-professional degree is not, by itself, recognized as an accredited degree. Next accreditation visit for all programs: 2018 The four-year, pre-professional degree is not offered at Virginia Tech. Program Requirements Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Graduation Requirements Upon successful completion of program requirements of the foundation level of study and the professional levels of study in architecture and with completion of 160 credit hours of study, a first professional degree of Bachelor of Architecture is awarded.

            "Values": "Overview Scholarships Undergraduate Course Descriptions (AS) Head: Eric S. Dorminey, Col., USAF Professor: Eric S. Dorminey Assistant Professors: C.A. Cox, B.J. Burton, and J. W. Drinkard Recruiting Officer: C.A. Cox (231-8021) Administrative Assistant: Connie Moses (231-6404) Web: www.af.vt.edu Overview The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) provides a program of leadership development which prepares college men and women for service as commissioned officers in the United States Air Force. After graduation, they assume active duty positions in both flying and non-flying specialties. To accomplish this, the Department of Aerospace Studies recruits, selects, retains, and commissions officer candidates as second lieutenants in the United States Air Force. AFROTC: Provides ethics and values education, stressing the Air Force core values of integrity first, service before self, and excellence in all we do. Prepares cadets to be commissioned as second lieutenants through a curriculum which develops leadership and management skills and provides opportunities to use these skills in a variety of practical applications. Provides an understanding of how to lead and influence small organizations, with a strong emphasis on personal integrity, honor, and individual responsibility. The techniques of effective leadership andquality management are stressed to achieve mission accomplishment. Enhances the cadets' understanding of the role of the military in society and provides an in-depth orientation to history and tradition of the Air Force and how the Air Force serves the nation. This goal is reinforced by summer hands-on leadership training and career orientation opportunities at Air Force bases around the country. In conjunction with the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, provides programs and experiences which increase self-confidence, self-discipline, accountability, physical stamina, poise, and other traits essential to the development of a leader of character who is prepared to serve the nation or the commonwealth both in and out of uniform. The curriculum and leader development programs of the Department of Aerospace Studies are mentally and physically challenging. Cadets learn basic military skills and participate in a demanding physical conditioning program starting in the freshman year. The program moves progressively from followership to leadership experiences and culminates with the senior class cadets planning, organizing, and administering all leadership training for the cadet group. On-campus instruction is conducted both in the classroom by Air Force officers and in the field environment by both officer and cadet leaders. Semiannual visits to Air Force bases expand the cadets' knowledge of Air Force operations and life-style. A demanding summer field training encampment prior to the junior year prepares the cadet for acceptance into the commissioning track. Air Force ROTC offers four-, and three-year tracks. Four- and three-year track cadets must complete 8 semester hours of AFROTC academics prior to a three-week summer encampment. Students who have Junior ROTC, other-service ROTC, national guard, reserve, or active duty military experience may request credit and advanced placement. Scholarships Air Force ROTC offers four-, three-, and two-year scholarships which are based on merit, not need. Though scholarship awards vary, most pay all/partial tuition, books, and approved university fees. High school seniors who are interested in the four-year or guaranteed three-year scholarships must apply at https://www.afrotc.com by Dec. 1 of their senior year. Non-scholarship cadets may apply for three- and two-year scholarships during their freshman and sophomore years. All students who are contracted into the AFROTC program (includes all scholarship winners and those juniors and seniors holding a commissioning contract) receive a tax-free stipend of up to $500 per month while in school. Virginia Tech requires membership in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets to be enrolled in ROTC. All freshman and sophomore cadets maintaining Air Force standards, as well as contracted junior and senior cadets, receive a special Air Force uniform allowance to offset the cost of cadet uniforms. The Corps of Cadets also provides need- and merit-based scholarships for deserving cadets. Membership in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets and completion of four years of Air Force ROTC may qualify a student to receive a minor in leadership. The leadership progression program of the Corps of Cadets and the leadership education inherent in the AFROTC program in combination allow the student to earn this leadership minor -- an academic achievement only available at Virginia Tech. Contact the Rice Center for Leader Development, 540-231-9455, for information on how to apply for the leadership concentration. Air Force ROTC builds leaders and offers every student who successfully completes the program a job upon graduation. The basic requirements for commissioning are: award of a degree from Virginia Tech including a minimum of 24 hours of AFROTC; be a U.S. citizen of good moral character; meet medical and physical standards; achieve passing scores on the Air Force Officer Qualifying Test; and willingly accept a four-year active duty service commitment.

In addition, it provides the background for post-graduate studies in the life sciences or professional studies in medicine, nursing, veterinary medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and clinical chemistry. The department offers the undergraduate biochemistry degree in two colleges, the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and the College of Science. Biochemistry majors complete the Curriculum for Liberal Education requirements unique to the college in which they are enrolled. The departmental requirements for majors in either college are: mathematics (9-12 credits); physics (8 credits); principles of biology (8 credits); genetics (3 credits); general microbiology (4 credits); general chemistry (8 credits); organic chemistry (8 credits); physical chemistry (6 credits); analytical chemistry (4 credits); introduction to biochemistry (1 credit); biochemical calculations (2 credits) ; general biochemistry (7 credits); and laboratory problems in biochemistry and molecular biology (6 credits). To qualify for a major in biochemistry, the department requires that students maintain a minimum 2.0 grade point average (GPA) for the hours passed in all required biochemistry, biology, and chemistry courses. In addition, the department requires that a student earn a C- or better in all required biochemistry, chemistry, and biology courses. The plan of study allows time for qualified students to participate in undergraduate research (BCHM 4994). Qualified students are strongly encouraged to initiate research activity prior to their senior year. A minimum GPA of 2.5 is required for enrollment in BCHM 4994. Students participating in undergraduate research are encouraged to present a senior thesis. Upper-division students who qualify for the Honors Program may participate in the \"in honors\" degree program in biochemistry. The Honors Program and undergraduate research program include study and research with individual faculty members. Biochemistry majors may participate in the Cooperative Education Program that alternates academic study with employment experience. Additional information pertaining to the CO-OP program is included in the \"General Information\" section of this catalog. Summer internships with various businesses and governmental agencies are frequently available, particularly to rising seniors.Bioinformatics/Genomics The department supports students' interest in bioinformatics/genomics by providing instruction and laboratory experience in those areas. Students are advised of appropriate supporting courses in computer science that may be used toward a minor in Computer Science. The department also offers a graduate program leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. The minimum number of credits required for the B.S. in Biochemistry is 120. Satisfactory Progress University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\") and toward the degree in Biochemistry.

Benoit Web: www.biol.vt.eduOverview The Department of Biological Sciences offers two B.S. degree paths: the B.S. in Biological Sciences and the B.S. in Microbiology. The B.S. in Biological Sciences program provides majors with a broad education in the study of life. This curriculum exposes students to the fundamentals of the discipline: genetics, cell and molecular biology, evolutionary biology, and ecology. In addition, Biological Sciences majors may take advantage of elective courses on topics such as macromolecular structure, pathogenic bacteriology, cancer biology, infectious disease ecology, human genetics, and global change ecology. Students may choose to complete an option in one of the following three areas: Biomedical; Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior (EEB); or Biology Education. The B.S. in Microbiology program provides majors with a more focused education in the biology and roles of microscopic life forms present in our environments. The laboratory-intensive curriculum provides knowledge in the genetics and physiology common to all microbes and allows students to explore specific interests with a broad range of advanced electives such as pathogenic bacteriology, immunology, environmental microbiology, food microbiology, virology, microbial forensics, and bioinformatics. Modern biology increasingly relies on knowledge, skills, and perspectives associated with other scientific fields, particularly chemistry, mathematics, physics and statistics. Success in biological sciences- associated careers requires students to master the fundamentals of these cognate fields and to be able to apply these skill sets. As a scientific discipline, biology is more than simple knowledge about living organisms. By integrating education and research, our majors are training to be leaders in their field who practice innovative and interdisciplinary approaches in biological research. By participating in undergraduate research during the academic year, our students are discovering through hands-on experience what it means to Invent the Future. Our majors are strongly encouraged to explore internships and research opportunities on campus and elsewhere during the summer. The majority of our graduates continue on to advanced studies in the health professions or in various branches of the biological sciences. Graduates pursue professional degrees in medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine, pharmacy, and nursing, or M.S. or Ph.D. degrees in ecology, environmental biology,microbiology, botany, zoology, cell biology, molecular biology, and biomedical sciences. Students interested in entering the workforce are provided the core background for opportunities in biotechnology, food science, bioinformatics, bio-business, and health-related industries. Preparation for Advanced Study Graduate Study Students who satisfactorily complete the undergraduate curriculum in biological sciences or microbiology may pursue advanced studies leading to the M.S. or Ph.D. in various branches of the biological sciences. Those interested in teaching science are prepared to pursue the M.A.Ed. Preparation for Medicine The training afforded by the first three years (approximately 96 hours) meets the pre-medical training requirements of medical colleges that accept students with only three years of undergraduate work. It is strongly recommended, however, that all students complete a B.S. before entering medical school. Preparation for Dentistry Dental colleges require a minimum of three years of college training for admission, but it is generally advisable for students to complete the B.S. before entering dental school. Preparation for Allied Health Professions Schools of Allied Health Professions, such as nursing, pharmacy, medical technology, physical therapy, etc., require two or more years of college work for admission. Specific requirements are available from Career Services or the Biological Sciences Department. Preparation for Veterinary Medicine Veterinary schools require a minimum of three years of college training for admission. Few students who meet only the minimum entrance requirements are accepted by veterinary schools. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Minor Requirements The requirements to earn a minor in Biology can be found on its checksheet by visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html. Satisfactory Progress University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meetminimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\") and toward the degree. Satisfactory progress requirements toward the B.S. in Biological Sciences and the B.S. in Microbiology can be found on their major checksheets by visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.

Mariger Web: www.bse.vt.edu Overview The Biological Systems Engineering program integrates biology, chemistry, and physics with engineering to solve engineering problems associated with the environmentally sound production, processing, and utilization of renewable resources. The curriculum differs from other engineering programs in that it focuses on the sustainable production of biological products and the management of natural resources. Biological Systems Engineering graduates have rewarding careers working with biological materials and both large and small biological systems, for the benefit of society and the environment. The BSE program is designed to graduate biological systems engineers who will be leaders in applying engineering principles to biological systems, preparing graduates to accomplish the following objectives in their careers: design and implement systems that mimic or adapt natural biological processes to solve problemsrelated to conservation and restoration of natural resources; design and implement processes to utilize biological materials for sustainable production of valuable products; promote stewardship of natural resources; and contribute effectively as members of multidisciplinary groups that include scientists, engineers, and community members. These educational objectives are supported by a curriculum that provides its graduates with: an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering an ability to design and conduct experiments as well as analyze and interpret data an ability to design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, social, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability an ability to function on multidisciplinary teams an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility an ability to communicate effectively the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in global and societal context a recognition of need for, and ability to engage in lifelong learning a knowledge of contemporary issues an ability to use techniques, skills and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice The BSE program provides a strong, broad-based engineering education with opportunity for specialization utilizing the 33 credits of technical electives available in the curriculum. Using these electives, BSE students prepare for careers in biomedical engineering, biotechnology, biopharmaceuticals, food engineering, or watershed science and engineering. Many BSE graduates also choose to pursue graduate studies or professional degrees from medical, veterinary, or dental programs. Recognizing the importance of \"hands-on\" experience in engineering education, instructional laboratories are included in many of the Biological Systems Engineering courses. These laboratory courses are designed to enhance understanding of theoretical concepts through hands-on activities. In addition to providing a strong and broad-based engineering education, the program emphasizes communication, team work skills, and design experience. The department participates in the Cooperative Education Program, which gives qualified students valuable work experience while pursuing an undergraduate degree. Students are also encouraged to participate in undergraduate research and study abroad programs. Many BSE students are employed in departmental research laboratories. Design and teamwork experiences are integral parts of the program. In the second year, students work in teams to design, build, and test a solution to an assigned design problem. Throughout the junior year, students acquire knowledge and analytical skills required for successful and professional engineering design through course assignments. The senior year design sequence gives students a comprehensive design experience in which they utilize much of the knowledge they have acquired through their other courses. Students work in teams to solve \"real-life\" engineering problems. The Bachelor of Science in biological systems engineering is offered through the College of Engineering and is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org. The relatively small class sizes in Biological Systems Engineering promote excellent interaction between faculty and students.

Lattimer Coordinator of Alumni and External Relations: C.E. Sakry Coordinator of Communication Program: M. Wright-CronWeb: www.cee.vt.edu Overview The Charles Edward Via, Jr. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers an undergraduate program that facilitates development of critical analytical abilities and the necessary core of knowledge and skills for entry into the civil engineering profession or graduate studies. This body of knowledge includes the scientific procedures for formulating and testing theories and the procedures for applying theory to enhance welfare through engineering analysis, synthesis, and design. The civil engineer plays a key role in the design, construction, maintenance, and management of society's physical infrastructure, including transportation and communication systems, structural facilities for housing human activities, water resource management systems, natural resource development systems, and facilities and programs for environmental protection. The Bachelor of Science program in Civil Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.Emphasis in civil engineering education is on fundamental principles of science and mathematics and their application to solving human problems. Civil engineering activities interact in many ways with the natural and social environments within which they take place. Accordingly, the civil engineering program strives to create an awareness of the ecological, social, economic, and political context of engineering and attempts to prepare the civil engineer for the necessary interactions with other professions and the public. An effort to instill an understanding of the role of the civil engineer in satisfying total societal needs is an integral part of the civil engineering program. Consistent with the general program goal of facilitating development of student competence necessary for entry into engineering practice or graduate school, the Department has developed the following program objectives: The educational objectives of the Civil Engineering undergraduate program are that, within a few years of program completion, graduates should be effectively serving society as practicing civil engineers and in related capacities with a commitment to design, construction, and maintenance practices that will contribute to sustainable development, provide for the continued well-being of spaces and infrastructure, and hold paramount the health, safety and welfare of the public. Additionally, the program's graduates should continue to grow both technically and professionally so that they develop into leaders within their chosen fields of endeavor. Growth experiences could include activities such as professional licensure, graduate level education, self-directed study, and participation in professional society activities. The curriculum provides a common freshman and sophomore year, with selection of upper division courses made during course request for the second semester of the sophomore year. The civil engineering curriculum provides breadth across the civil engineering profession and the opportunity for depth within a student's selected specialty areas of interest. Specialty areas offered within the department include: construction engineering & management, environmental engineering, geotechnical engineering, land development, civil engineering materials, structural engineering, transportation engineering, and water resources engineering. Students are progressively exposed to civil engineering design, culminating in a focused design course experience. The projects assigned in design courses are open-ended, incorporate appropriate engineering standards, and require the application of knowledge from earlier courses in the curriculum. Projects apply technical knowledge to design appropriate physical facilities, but also include consideration of non-technical constraints that confront real-world projects. These additional considerations include such interdisciplinary issues as economics, environmental impact, and sustainability. Accordingly, teamwork and good professional communications skills are a significant part of each design project course experience. Classroom instruction in the civil engineering program is reinforced by instructional laboratories in the major areas of civil engineering practice. The department seeks to employ the latest educational technology and innovative teaching methods. The department participates in the Cooperative Education Program in which qualified students may alternate semesters of study with semesters of professional employment. The department encourages all students to participate in professional work experience prior to graduation. Contact person for undergraduate Civil and Environmental Engineering programs is Kara Lattimer, CEE Academic and Career Advisor at (540) 231-7148 or e-mail: karalatt@vt.edu. Full programs of graduate study are available, leading to the M.Eng., M.S., and Ph.D. in civil engineering. Graduate degree programs concentrate in one of five major areas: construction engineering and management, environmental and water resources engineering, geotechnical engineering, structural engineering and materials, and transportation and infrastructure systems engineering. For details, see the Graduate Catalog. Civil Engineering Program Admission to a degree program is competitive, with departmental restrictions established each year by thecollege. Entry into a degree-granting department requires that a student complete all first year required courses and maintain a competitive GPA. Applicants who begin their freshman year in the College of Engineering and earn a minimum 3.0 overall are guaranteed first choice of major.

Sullivan ChE Academic Advisor: G. Whiting ChE Co-op Advisor: A.S. Goldstein Web: www.che.vt.edu Overview Skillful and creative applications of the principles of chemistry, biochemistry, biology, mathematics, and physics are needed to solve the problems now confronting society. Whether these problems involve energy, food, health, materials or environmental quality, the modern chemical engineer is the professional concerned with finding economically and socially acceptable solutions. The program prepares graduates for employment in a great variety of industries including specialty chemicals, petroleum, pharmaceutics, paper, fibers, plastics, food, electronics, consumer products, and environmental remediation. Studentsmay customize their academic program around an industry of their interest by judiciously selecting electives. For example, areas of focus such as polymers, biotechnology, marketing, and environmental chemical engineering are common choices. The objective of the undergraduate program is to produce chemical engineering graduates who, within five years of completing the BS degree, will be successful in a variety of professional careers, including those outside of traditional chemical engineering fields as evidenced by one or more of the following achievements: Sustaining a career as a problem solver in engineering or other fields that require analytical skills Professional advancement in positions of increasing leadership and/or responsibility within their chosen career field Attainment of an advanced degree or advanced certification leading to a career in engineering or science, business, law, medicine, or academia Bettering society through professional or personal service The curriculum has been developed to meet the department goal and the objectives for the graduates. The curriculum is demanding and a GPA of at least 3.0 is recommended for transfer into the program at the sophomore level. An average GPA of at least 2.00 in all CHE courses attempted (except CHE 4144) is required for continued enrollment in the department. The department has specific grade policies for continuation in the program and for graduation. For further information on these policies, please contact the department. The chemical engineering curriculum integrates studies in thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, heat transfer, mass transfer, process control, reaction kinetics, plant and process design, verbal and written communications, and reaction kinetics, along with professional ethics and environmental awareness. Throughout this curriculum students learn the elements of the design of chemical processes and chemical processing equipment. In addition, students gain hands-on experience with the equipment during the summer Unit Operations Laboratory. The experience culminates in participation in either a national senior-level design contest or a design project with a local industrial mentor. The laboratory and the senior design courses are recognized as two of the high points in the undergraduate program. The computer is a necessary tool in all the courses and the same software used in industry is used in the design courses. In addition to the basic undergraduate program outlined here, more sophisticated and specialized programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. in chemical engineering also are offered (see Graduate Catalog). The department participates in the Cooperative Education Program whereby qualified students may alternate periods of study with periods of professional employment. Chemical Engineering Program A total of 135 semester credits are required for graduation in 2019. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements. The following are special focus areas students can use as electives. Lists of approved courses for these focus areas are available in the Department of Chemical Engineering. Marketing and Chemical Distribution Biochemical Engineering Polymers As part of progress toward a degree, students must have a grade of C- or better in all CHE-prefix courses and maintain a minimum in-major GPA of 2.0 or above (not including CHE 4144). If the in-major GPA drops below 2.0 at any time, students will be placed on departmental probation. Students cannot remain on departmental probation for more than two consecutive semesters. In the case that a student has not achieved an in major 2.0 or better after two semesters, the student is prohibited from registering for CHE courses for at least one semester and, after that, only with permission of Chemical Engineering department head. All CHE credits (except CHE 4144) are used to calculate in-major GPA. Questions concerning progress to degree should be directed to Dr. Whiting. Students who plan to co-op should talk with Dr. Goldstein (235 Kelly Hall) of the Chemical Engineering department.

Kokkinakos Director of General Chemistry: P. G. Amateis Web: www.chem.vt.eduOverview The Chemistry Department offers two undergraduate programs: the B.S. in Chemistry and the B.A. in Chemistry. The B.S. curriculum provides the breadth and depth to give graduates a wide choice of career options, including further graduate studies. The Chemistry Department is accredited by the American Chemical Society's Committee on Professional Training and the B.S. degree meets the guidelines for an ACS-certified degree. The B.A. program has fewer required chemistry courses, allowing students to design a chemistry program with more electives to meet a wider set of career goals. The B.A. is often chosen by students who wish to pursue a double major or to take other courses to prepare for professional school, law, or business. Either the B.S. or the B.A. degree is suitable to prepare for high school teaching. The Chemistry Department supports and encourages all chemistry majors to pursue undergraduate research sometime during their degree program. Graduate Program The Department offers M.S. and Ph.D. degrees with specializations in many areas of chemistry. (See the Graduate Catalog for further information.) Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements.Minor Requirements The requirements to earn a minor in Chemistry can be found on the specific checksheet by visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html. Satisfactory Progress University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\") and toward the degree. Satisfactory progress requirements toward the B.A. and B.S. in Chemistry can be found on the major checksheet by visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html.

            "Title": "Curriculum for Liberal Education (CLE)",
            "Values": "Why We Have It What Students Will Gain Curriculum for Liberal Education (CLE) Areas of Study Why We Have It As a vital component of undergraduate education at Virginia Tech, the Curriculum for Liberal Education (CLE)- -required of all undergraduates--empowers our students with a broad base of knowledge and transferable skills. Liberal Education provides students the opportunity for rigorous intellectual encounters with enduring human challenges and important contemporary problems, through wide-ranging exposure to multiple disciplines and ways of knowing. Through the study of the Sciences, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Histories, Languages and the Arts, the CLE is designed to foster and develop intellectual curiosity and critical thinking; strong analytic, communication, quantitative, and information literacy skills; the capacity for collaboration and creative problem solving; the ability to synthesize and transfer knowledge; intercultural knowledge and understanding; and ethical reasoning and action. The CLE seeks to create the conditions for growing creative and intellectual engagement; civic, personal, and social responsibility; and lifelong learning. What Students Will Gain A liberal education offers 21st century students the foundations of what they need to live and thrive as citizens in a globally engaged democracy, a knowledge-intensive economy, and a society where new ideas and understandings are essential to progress. The success of today's college students in their communities, workplaces, and across their lifetimes depends upon a complex and transferable set of skills and capacities. In their lives and in their careers, our students must be prepared to grasp complex problems, develop a global perspective on the diversity of human experience and knowledge, respond to changing demands, and articulate innovative responses and solutions. Today's students are very likely to change jobs and even careers several times over the course of their lives; and certainly, their roles and responsibilities in their families and communities will change and evolve over their lifetimes as well. The breadth of a rigorous liberal education combined with the depth of specialized study in the student's primary academic discipline(s)--and evidenced in a demonstrated capacity to adapt and transfer knowledge, skills, and responsibilities to new settings and questions--is essential to the education of the whole studentand sets the stage for a lifetime of learning and growth. Curriculum for Liberal Education (CLE) Areas of Study Because the Curriculum for Liberal Education is a \"living curriculum,\" there will be some changes from year to year. Courses added to the CLE offerings are generally available to students immediately after being approved. Some requirements of the CLE are phased in over a multi-year period. Thus, it is essential that students continue to consult with their advisors. Please visit the CLE homepage at http://www.cle.prov.vt.edu/ for more information, and for the Curriculum for Liberal Education Guides. Areas of Study Area 1: Writing and Discourse 6 Credit Hours Area 2: Ideas, Cultural Traditions, and Values 6 Credit Hours Area 3: Society and Human Behavior 6 Credit Hours Area 4: Scientific Reasoning and Discovery 6 or 8 Credit Hours Area 5: Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning 6 Credit Hours Area 6: Creativity and Aesthetic Experience 1 or 3 Credit Hours Area 7: Critical Issues in a Global Context 3 Credit Hours **Students should consult with their advisors about specific college or departmental requirements in these areas. Area 1: Writing and Discourse 6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses. Students who entered the university prior to Fall 2005 and maintain continuous enrollment until graduation must meet the previous Writing Intensive (WI) requirement. Area 1 requirements reflect the centrality of discourse in the larger intellectual community. Our first-year writing courses introduce students to the interrelated and shared modes of verbal communication that are distinctive to college life - argument, interpretation, analysis, and metaphor - and whose various usages substantially delineate what it means to become broadly educated. These beginning courses should be thought of as the springboard for further writing and discourse throughout the undergraduate curriculum, especially in the disciplinary concentration. In order to enable students to meet the aims of both liberal education and of professional preparation, we include writing in many courses throughout the university, even if it may not be the main intellectual capacity emphasized in the course. Students are encouraged to seek out courses that offer frequent opportunities for writing and related forms of discourse, both for the enhanced learning these courses can offer and for their bene t in terms of professional preparation. Many courses in the Curriculum for Liberal Education build upon the writing and oral skills that are the direct goal of Area 1 by including a significant writing component and by encouraging the achievement of excellence in communicating ideas and knowledge. Formerly, the CLE required writing-intensive (WI) courses to support the development of students' writing skills across the undergraduate career. To better facilitate and broaden this goal, the requirement evolved into a departmental requirement for Visual, Spoken and Written Expression (ViEWS). Development of these competencies may be fostered through specific courses in the major, courses outside the major, and/or previously designated WI courses. Students may meet the first-year writing requirement in one of three ways: By successful completion of the two-semester sequence, ENGL 1105-1106 or COMM 1015-1016 By successful completion of ENGL 1106 for students who are awarded Advanced Standing (based on standardized test scores and high school class rank) and are placed in ENGL 1106. Advanced Standingstudents who complete ENGL 1106 at Virginia Tech in the rst enrollment with a C- or better receive Advanced Standing credit for ENGL 1105; By successful completion of 1204H for students who meet University Honors Standards or English Department Honors Standards. Honors students who successfully complete ENGL 1204H at Virginia Tech in the rst enrollment with a C- or better receive Advanced Standing credit for ENGL 1105. Other Information: Virginia Tech accepts ETS Advanced Placement credit for the Freshman Writing sequence. Area 2: Ideas, Cultural Traditions, and Values 6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses. Every student should be introduced to some of the ideas, cultural traditions, and values that have shaped the human world we now inhabit. An educated person sees the present in connection with the past, and understands that presently prevailing values and meanings derive from the creative thought and action of men and women who have preceded us. A study of in uential texts, ideas, representative works of art and technology, and the development of cultural traditions begins to free the student from the super cial fads of the moment and from narrow provincialisms. By examining some of the enduring ideas about human nature and achievement past and present, the individual gains a greater degree of self- knowledge and is better able to formulate worthwhile aims and commitments. Courses in this curricular area take the human condition and human values as their main focus, while dealing with a range of subject matters: philosophy, literature and communication, history, religion, the arts, and technology. Most of these courses deal with some aspect of Western cultural experience in its numerous varieties. Relatively neglected dimensions of this experience such as the experience of women and minorities will be acknowledged and dealt with, both as an integral aspect of many existing courses and in separate courses which focus directly upon these dimensions. The foreign language courses approved for Area 2 explore the literatures of other countries in their cultural contexts. Moreover, since we are living in an increasingly global cultural context, courses are included that introduce the student to formative non-Western ideas, arts, and traditions as well. Area 3: Society and Human Behavior 6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses. Human beings are not only participants in the world of human culture; we are also observers of it. The cultivation of systematic approaches to the study of humanity is one of the great achievements of the human intellect. Every student should therefore be introduced to the sciences of society and human behavior, a goal that can be accomplished through several avenues: through the study of psychology; through the study of social structures such as government, family, community, or economy; or through more wide-ranging examination of social patterns and processes. Such studies may examine past as well as present, non- Western as well as Western societies. Courses in this curricular area are best characterized by their methods of study and theoretical frameworks. They look for regularities in human behavior rather than giving primary attention to the unique or non- repeatable aspects of life. When varied human values and allegiances nevertheless make their appearance within these disciplines, they do so more as objects to be investigated than as commitments to be honored. Area 4: Scientific Reasoning and Discovery 6 credit hours (2 courses) of lecture selected from approved CLE courses. Some majors require 2 credit hours of related laboratory (2 labs). For many students at Virginia Tech, acquiring detailed knowledge of one or more of the natural sciences is essential. But for all students, a liberal education involves the study of what science is, of how it can be conducted, of what it can and cannot tell us about the world. Without scientific study and the experience offered by a laboratory, students perceive only vaguely how and why science functions as a crucial standard for knowledge and inquiry in modern life. The study of a science engages the student in analysis anddeduction as well as empirical experimentation - that is, in scientific reasoning and discovery. The impact of the natural sciences and technology on our globally interdependent world is one of the most important realities we face as we enter the 21st century. The science courses in the CLE have a special role in educating students about the critical relevance of scientific knowledge to the potentialities and dilemmas of our natural and social environments. Area 5: Quantitative and Symbolic Reasoning 6 credit hours (2 courses) selected from approved CLE courses Like writing, mathematics is essential to intellectual inquiry in many areas. It is a basic language of the natural and social sciences and has become a useful tool for research in the humanities. The technological uses of mathematics and related forms of symbolic analysis are of tremendous significance to human society. Furthermore, the history of quantitative and symbolic reasoning as an intellectual discipline is linked with philosophy, the arts, and other aspects of human culture. Thus, a broad education must include these forms of reasoning, both as skills and as central modes of thought. Mathematics, statistics, and certain areas of computer science and philosophy can all contribute to broadening a student's knowledge of quantitative and symbolic reasoning. A diagnostic formula and testing procedure has been derived to predict readiness for Engineering/Science Calculus at Virginia Tech. A purpose of MATH 1015 is to serve those students who need further preparation. You can obtain information about the math diagnostic test from your advisor. Many departments throughout the university have specific math sequence requirements. Be sure to check with your advisor about the requirements for your program. Area 6: Creativity and Aesthetic Experience 1 or 3 credit hours selected from approved CLE courses. Students in the College of Science and most majors in the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences must take one (1) 3-credit hour course. Students should consult with their advisors about specific college or departmental requirements. The arts contribute significantly both to the experience and the interpretation of human life. Creativity and aesthetic response criss-cross the boundaries among intellectual ideas, the imagination, and actual design. Moreover, the arts are always intimately linked with the material culture of a society \u2014 its modes of production and design \u2014 as well as with its values and ideas. Thus, the arts can be studied and experienced in a variety of ways: as \"high culture,\" as a means of tracing the history and ideas of particular societies, and as an active process of creative design and expression in many different physical forms. The metaphorical and intuitive thought processes that are essential to making and experiencing works of art are woven into many other human cultural and creative activities. Thus, the arts have an important role to play in broadening our aesthetic and intellectual sensibilities. Most artistic media include a highly public dimension - concerts, exhibitions, performances, publications, public installations, and the built environment - in which the creative works of artists, designers, and their collaborators are accepted or contested as meaningful elements of the larger social fabric. A guided exposure to the arts can provide a valuable framework for continued appreciation of, and participation in, the arts beyond college. Area 7: Critical Issues in a Global Context 3 credit hours (1 course) selected from approved CLE courses. Global interdependence is a powerful fact of life as we enter the 21st century. The dilemmas and possibilities humankind faces cannot be effectively addressed by any single culture or group of people acting alone. An awareness of critical issues of the day is thus an essential extension of liberal education and prepares students to respond thoughtfully to the complex world in which they live. As a state institution of higher education, Virginia Tech has a responsibility to prepare students to react creatively and constructively to the social, international, intercultural, and environmental challenges that confront the Commonwealth and the world.The university requires that undergraduates take at least one course that deals in a substantial way with major issues of critical importance for the larger global society. Courses that satisfy this requirement can be taken in any area of the curriculum, including the major, the Curriculum for Liberal Education, or electives. Students may select from a wide range of courses that focus on major international and intercultural issues in contemporary world affairs, including such areas as politics, the management of con ict, the roles of economic competition and cooperation, demographic issues, and the emerging world order. Many science courses in Area 7 examine global issues associated with environmental decline and restoration. Some engineering courses study the role of technology as a major force in shaping the cultural and economic conditions of human societies. Other courses include comparative or cross-disciplinary examinations of cultures, societies, and belief systems, including those of developing countries. Other courses examine the social and personal implications of cultural, racial, and gender-based differences. Whatever the topical focus of the course, all Area 7 courses utilize interdisciplinary approaches in which a number of relevant factors - historical, ethical, technological, cultural, and/or scientific - are brought to bear on the issues being studied. \u00a9 2018 - Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University - Maintained by the Office of the University RegistrarMenu 2018-2019 Undergraduate Course Catalog and"

Woolly Web: www.liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of- communication.htmlOverview The majors in communication, leading to a B.A., allow students to develop a broad understanding of the discipline and specific expertise in Communication Studies, Multimedia Journalism, or Public Relations. The Department of Communication focuses on strategic, theoretical, and practical application of message creation, delivery, analysis, and criticism in cultural and historical contexts. Students in communication majors are prepared to continue their studies in graduate school or immediately apply their skills in various professional settings because of the broad applicability of both the theory to which they are exposed and the competencies they develop. Rooted in a strong liberal arts curriculum, these majors prepare students to enter careers in mass media, business, public service, government, or professional specializations, such as law. Majors Students choose one of three majors in communication to specialize in the discipline: Communication Studies, Multimedia Journalism, and Public Relations. Multimedia Journalism offers a concentration in Sports Media and Analytics. Communication Studies (CMST) - This major develops human-interaction strategies and skills for face- to-face, public, and organizational contexts relating to decision making, influence, and information exchange. As a graduate, you might consider careers in business, health, civic engagement, public opinion, law, education, and ministry. Public Relations (PR) - This major emphasizes both skill and management functions of public relations through theoretical and practical applications. Public relations spans media, organizational, corporate, and political contexts and includes investigation and analysis of public relations situations (e.g., crises, successes), message production and campaign planning, writing and presentation, and evaluation of public relations strategies. Public relations permeates many areas of corporate, non-profit, and political work, so this major provides students a foundation for many different career paths. Multimedia Journalism (MJ) - This major prepares students for news careers at newspapers, magazines, broadcast and cable outlets, and new media operations. The lines that separate these specialties are blurring as media convergence becomes more the norm. Courses provide both practicalskills and theory as they address history, law and ethics, current controversies and opportunities in the changing news media. Sports Media and Analytics (Concentration) - This concentration enables students to complete the MJ curriculum while specializing in Sports Media and Analytics. In addition to mastering the content and skills of MJ, you will participate in the production and delivery of sports news, consider ways to promote the sports industry with your study of public relations, and analyze data related to sports accomplishments, fan participation, and social media. The employment opportunities are myriad and include sports reporting, public relations for sports venues, teams, and/or athletes, and promotional work for businesses that support the fans. Major Requirements The curriculum is designed to provide foundational and development courses along with major-specific study. Students are introduced to concepts early in the undergraduate career, and the curriculum allows them to build knowledge and skills as they work on increasingly complex tasks. Students develop skills in written, spoken, and visual communication across their studies in the major. At the foundational level, students in every major are required to take the same introductory courses. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When you consider information about the degree requirements, always choose the year of your expected graduation. Requirements for graduation are listed on checksheets. The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar's website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Minor Requirements The department offers a minor in strategic communication. This multidisciplinary minor is open to majors from across the university and is especially appropriate for students in business or science, technology, engineering, and mathematics disciplines. Coursework allows students to learn how strategic communication works in a variety of industries and prepare for the 21st century workforce. Few jobs have no communication components. The minor curriculum introduces students to strategic communication through a four-course introductory experience. It covers basic communication skills, public relations, design, and accounting. Introductory coursework requires students to integrate multiple areas of learning such as discourse, quantitative and computational thinking, reasoning in the social sciences, critique and practice in design and the arts, international and cultural awareness, and understanding ethical issues. Two advanced courses enable students to focus on particular issues in strategic communication, such as issues management, corporate social responsibility, or communication law. A capstone course lets students synthesize and analyze topics and issues they explored in the four foundational and two advanced courses. Specific course requirements for the 18-hour strategic communication minor are explained on a checksheet. Satisfactory Progress Toward the Degree University policy requires that students demonstrate their progress toward the degree by meetingminimum requirements. A student will be certified as making satisfactory progress toward a degree by meeting the following requirements: Completion of COMM 1014 within the first six classes (18 hours) in the major Completion of COMM 2124 within the first eight classes (24 hours) in the major Overall GPA: 2.0 COMM GPA: 2.0 Students who fall below the standard for either the overall GPA or the COMM GPA will have one semester to regain the required GPA standards. A student who fails to make satisfactory progress toward degree after that semester will be blocked from continuing in any communication major. Freshmen and External Transfers into Communication Incoming freshmen and students enrolled at other institutions should follow directions for application as shown on the Admissions website. Internal Transfers into Communication Students enrolled in other Virginia Tech majors who wish to transfer into Communication may use the online system for application.

Therefore, our ability to sustainably produce plants for food and aesthetic purposes is more crucial now than ever before. If you want to become a scientist with the skills and knowledge to grow crops or turfgrass to provide for human needs and improve environmental quality, then the Crop and Soil Sciences major at Virginia Tech is for you! In the CSS program, students learn the fundamentals of plant science and improvement, and soil and environmental stewardship for feeding the world, protecting the environment, and producing quality turfgrass. As a student majoring in Crop and Soil Sciences, you can count on quality academic programs relevant for today and tomorrow, opportunities for involvement and experience, and individual and personal attention from our award-winning faculty and staff. Our programs offer the rigor, flexibility, and practical knowledge that will help you succeed regardless of the path you choose. You will learn the fundamentals of soil, plant, and environmental sciences to prepare you for your career. Agronomy Option Students in this option concentrate on the biology and increasingly complex technology of food, feed, fuel, and fiber production. Graduates typically move into farming or into sales, consulting, and managerial positions that directly and indirectly support agricultural production, a most vital component of the world's economy. Crop Genetics and Breeding Option Producing better quality and higher yielding crops has been a long-standing objective of crop breeders. New techniques of genetic engineering are now being brought to bear on crop improvement. Students in this option learn the newest methods of molecular biology and are well prepared for careers in research and industry. International Agriculture Option The world's ever-expanding population must be fed; at the same time, we must be good stewards of the Earth's resources. Many countries have not been able to bring food production and resource conservation into balance. Students in the International Agriculture option are interested in finding simultaneous solutions to these concerns. Employment opportunities exist with various private and public agencies. Turfgrass Management Option Using basic principles of the natural sciences and agricultural technology, turf managers have skills that make them highly employable in golf-course management, athletic and recreational fields, lawn maintenance services, the landscaping industry, and sod production. Requirements for a Major All the curricula for the various options contain a core of courses to assist the student in developing knowledge and ability in basic sciences (biology and chemistry), computational skills (mathematics and statistics), communication skills (both writing and speaking), as well as crop, soil, and environmental sciences.

White Web: www.dasc.vt.edu OverviewThe purpose of the dairy science program is to offer students the opportunity to prepare themselves for a wide variety of careers by developing their technical and interpersonal skills. We offer a challenging yet flexible curriculum that can be individualized to meet the educational needs and interests of each student, counseling to assist each student in designing individual programs, and extracurricular activities to enhance development of interpersonal skills. Students may select from three curricula: Dairy Business Management, Science/Pre-Veterinary, and Dual Emphasis. All options provide students with the opportunity to acquire a broad education in the sciences, social sciences, economics, mathematics, and communications while learning the basic principles of dairy enterprise management. Dairy Business Management Option (DBM) This is the most flexible curriculum, with at least 30 credits of electives. Suited to students with an interest in various fields of dairy production (herd manager, farm manager), allied agri-business industries (feed, genetics, equipment), agricultural communications, public relations, extension, breed fieldperson, and a variety of other positions. Graduates in this option have also gone on to careers in college instruction, elementary school instruction, bank investment management, feed sales, and milk marketing, to name a few. Science/Pre-Vet Option (SPV) This option is recommended for students who plan to continue into veterinary college or other graduate or professional schools, or who plan a career in quality control, laboratory work, or research and product development. It provides an excellent base in chemistry, mathematics, physics, biology and biochemistry for advanced study in many areas. Dual Emphasis Option (DUAL) This is the most popular option and is recommended for students who plan to concentrate in more than one academic area as they prepare for future careers. Common minors and double majors that students may earn while completing their Dairy Science degree requirements include Agricultural Economics, Animal and Poultry Sciences, Biology, Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences, Spanish, Communications, Professional Writing, etc. Opportunities to Excel Nearly all Dairy Science students complete a second major or minor in Animal and Poultry Science, Agricultural Economics, Horticulture, Spanish, Business Communications, Food Science and Technology, or any of many other departments. Students are also encouraged to actively participate in extracurricular clubs, judging teams and the dairy management team. Ninety five percent of students complete at least on internship prior to graduation and nearly half complete undergraduate research, an independent study, or serve as a teaching assistant. Active participation in research projects in lactation, genetics, nutrition, nutrient management, and management provide qualified students valuable research experience with departmental scientists as well as part-time employment opportunities. These opportunities are available to students in all options and enhance their preparation for advanced study and provide a better understanding of the research process. The dairy science honors program offers outstanding students the opportunity to enrich and broaden their academic programs. Honors students work closely with individual faculty members in choosing honors classes, colloquia, independent study, and research projects.

McPherson and J. Thweatt Instructors: A. Ball, K. Cooper Web: www.ece.vt.edu Overview The Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering offers bachelor of science degrees in electrical engineering (EE) and computer engineering (CPE). The difference between these two degrees is one of emphasis. Electrical engineering concentrates on physical processes and design in communications and networking; energy and power electronics systems; controls, robotics, and autonomy; micro- and nanoelectronics; space systems; RF and microwaves; and photonics. Computer engineering emphasizes the development of computer hardware and associated technical areas, such as networks and cybersecurity; machine learning; chip-scale integration; controls, robotics and autonomy; and software systems. In addition to undergraduate degrees, the department also offers M.S., M.Eng., and Ph.D. programs in both EE and CPE. An accelerated undergraduate/graduate (UG/G) program is available for qualified undergraduates. Electrical engineers (EEs) and computer engineers (CPEs) create important and exciting technologies, systems and applications that make the world a better place for all of us. EEs and CPEs are inventing new ways to generate, distribute and use electric power that are more efficient, more sustainable and friendlier to the environment. For example, wider use of solar energy relies on improved photovoltaic devices, power electronics for energy conversion, and power grids. Some of our most critical global infrastructures, including the Internet, mobile voice and data networks, and the electric power grid are designed by EEs and CPEs. And, EEs and CPEs design sensors and embedded systems to monitor intelligent buildings and transportation systems. Applying innovative technologies to biology and the healthcare industry, EEs and CPEs create techniques for medical imaging, micro-electromechanical systems for medical diagnostics, implantable devices for health monitoring and drug delivery, and information systems to improve healthcare delivery. To meet the challenge of cybersecurity, EEs and CPEs design hardware and software for cryptographic algorithms and develop methods to ensure private communications through the Internet and wireless devices. They design new devices and systems for high-performance computing and networking. They build satellites and instruments to improve communications and enhance our knowledge of space and the Earth. And, EEs and CPEs enhance our leisure time by creating new ways to listen to music, watch movies, play games, communicate with friends, and build social networks. Students in the Bradley Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering learn from faculty who work at the cutting-edge of engineering research and bring the excitement of their discoveries to the classroom. Engineers want to make things that work. EE and CPE students get hands-on opportunities to build components and systems from the beginning of their studies. In the freshman year, students explore applications of electrical and computer engineering, such as medical imaging and cryptography. In the sophomore year, EE and CPE students use personal, portable equipment and components to build and explore simple digital and analog electronic systems, which become more complex each semester. Laboratories and team projects throughout the curriculum contribute to an enriching hands-on, minds-on learning experience. By their senior year, students have the option of participating in a team-based, industry-sponsored design project that spans two semesters in which they solve real-world engineering problems while learning project management and team-building skills. Electrical engineering and computer engineering are dynamic and fast changing fields that driveinnovation and solutions to global challenges. The ECE faculty has created a program of study that provides each graduate with a firm foundation in mathematics, physics, and engineering principles, and with broad experience in different areas of EE and CPE. The program enables our graduates to excel in their EE and CPE specialties, while gaining the tools to adapt to the technical changes and career opportunities they will experience in the future. EE and CPE students develop effective communication and teamwork skills and gain knowledge of ethics, all of which are essential to professional success. EE and CPE graduates are prepared to pursue careers in industry and government, advanced graduate work in EE and CPE, and other advanced professional degrees. ECE seeks to develop tomorrow's engineering and technical leaders and innovators. Students can enhance their undergraduate experience by participating in multidisciplinary team projects, cooperative education and internships, research experiences for undergraduates, study abroad programs, dual degree and minor programs in other fields, and mentoring programs. The Cooperative Education (co-op) and Internship Program is highly recommended, as is participation in professional societies, including the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Eta Kappa Nu (HKN) and the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). ECE works with the Ted and Karyn Hume Center for National Security and Technology to develop future leaders for the US government. ECE offers many scholarships for academic excellence, leadership and service, as well as for participation in various special academic programs. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements.

They also serve as a foundation for subsequent courses in the various engineering curricula. Coverage of engineering ethics instills a sense of the responsibilities of engineers to society. Algorithm development and computer programming develop logical thinking, provide the background for computer use in later courses, and support problem-solving skills. Spatial visualization skills are developed through engineering graphics, a primary engineering tool. Through writing and presentations, students begin to hone their professional communication skills, including audience analysis, visual rhetoric, effective writing styles, issues in collaborative writing, techniques of oral presentation, print and Web-based research, graphics for written and oral presentations, and editing. All College of Engineering students must own 1) a convertible tablet PC or laptop running Windows 10 meeting current specifications, and 2) stipulated software used to analyze and solve problems in and out of class. Computer requirements for engineering students can be located at www.eng.vt.edu/it/requirement. Process for Declaring a Degree-Granting Engineering Major Entering students are admitted to General Engineering, the first-year program for all engineering curricula. The program introduces students to foundational concepts and practices in engineering, allows time to adjust to the College, and provides opportunities to investigate the College's individual degree programs and select the branch of engineering or computer science best suited to their skills and interests. At the end of the year - after academic advising, contacts with the various departments, and satisfactory progress - students select a degree program and, if academically eligible, are transferred to the appropriate degree-granting department. Entry into a degree-granting engineering department requires that students successfully complete all required first-year courses. Students must also earn a minimum grade of C- in ENGE 1215 and 1216 required before transferring into a degree-granting engineering department.

Truscello Coordinator of Undergraduate Advising: Laura Ferguson (231-6515) Web: www.english.vt.eduOverview The Department of English offers majors in English (study in literature, including pre-Law and pre- Education options), Professional and Technical Writing, and Creative Writing. A degree in English will appeal to students who are interested in a foundational education in the liberal arts, specializing in literature and writing, and who may pursue careers in business, government, education, law, speech sciences, writing, publishing, advertising, health, activism, the arts, or social services. The Department of English also offers minors in Literature, Language Sciences, Professional and Technical Writing, and Creative Writing, and many of its courses provide credits for Pathways general education in Discourse, Critical Thinking in the Humanities, Critique and Practice in Design and the Arts, and Critical Analysis of Equity and Identity in the U.S. English Degree Majors Students working towards the B.A. in English may choose from three majors, each consisting of 39 required hours. A major in English Within the English major, there are three options available to students: Literature, Pre-Education, and Pre-Law. A major in Professional and Technical Writing. A major in Creative Writing. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. All three of the majors share a common English core that provides a foundational curriculum in research, critical thinking, and interpretation. Students in all three majors take these core courses together, providing a rich and diverse context for the study of writing and literature. The core requirements and specific major requirements can be found on the major checksheet by visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html. Satisfactory Progress University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimum criteria toward the General Education requirements (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\") and toward the degree in English. Satisfactory progress requirements toward the B.A. in English can be found on the major checksheet by visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html. Post Graduate StudyUndergraduate majors interested in pursuing advanced degrees (M.A., M.F.A., or Ph.D.) in English should, with the assistance of their professors, mentors, and the department's academic advisor, carefully plan their programs of study. Coverage across periods and genres is strongly recommended, as is a good reading knowledge of another language, for students planning to continue study for a master's or doctoral degree. Getting to know professors and learning as much as possible about the professional elements of the discipline provide excellent preparation for graduate work. Pathways General Education and English Pathways General Education requires a six hours of foundational Discourse credits and three hours of advanced or applied Discourse credits. English 1105 and 1106 fulfill the six foundational credits of this Pathways requirement. These courses share a focus on the rhetorical dimensions of writing, speaking, and visual communication. Many 2000-4000 level ENGL courses fulfill the advanced or applied Discourse credits, and can count toward students' majors and Pathways general education. The same is true of most courses that fulfill Critical Thinking in the Humanities, Reasoning in the Social Sciences, Critique and Practice in Design and the Arts, and Critical Analysis of Identity and Equity in the U.S.; courses that meet one or more of these requirements can count for Pathways and major credit. Advanced Standing (AS): Some students are exempted from ENGL 1105 and granted Advanced Standing on the basis of three scores: SAT Critical Reading, SAT Writing, and Standardized High School Class Rank. Advanced Standing students fulfill their Freshman English requirement with ENGL 1106. If Advanced Standing students complete the assigned advanced course at Virginia Tech with a C- they receive pass/fail credit for ENGL 1105, the course from which they are exempted. Advanced Standing is a placement category for students at Virginia Tech; it is not related to the Advanced Placement (AP) courses offered in high schools or the AP exam offered by the Educational Testing Service (ETS). Credit from AP, CLEP, and IB exams can fulfill the CLE Area 1 requirement.

J. Eick (231-8943; eick@vt.edu) Web: www.cses.vt.edu/undergraduate-programs/ensc/index.html Overview This program brings the basic sciences to bear on many crucial concerns about the environment. The environments of particular interest are terrestrial and wetland ecosystems and associated land and water resources. Specific concerns include environmental protection, pollution prevention and remediation, land-use planning, waste management, ground- and surface-water quality, reclamation and remediation of disturbed or contaminated sites, and minimizing human impacts on the environment. The Environmental Science curriculum is multidisciplinary and strongly science and technology oriented. The curriculum prepares graduates for immediate entry into environmental careers as well as for graduate specializations. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics forecasts that employment of environmental scientists and specialists is projected to grow 11 percent from 2014 to 2024, faster than the average for all occupations. Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Requirements for a Minor The Environmental Science program also offers a minor. The requirements include CSES/ENSC 3114 plus 3124 (or CSES/ENSC 3134) and CSES/ENSC 3604 and 14 to 15 more hours selected from a set of 23 courses. See www.cses.vt.edu/undergraduate-programs/ensc/index.html or visit 240 Smyth Hall for more information about a minor in environmental science. Satisfactory Progress University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\") and toward the degree. Satisfactory progress requirements toward the specific degree can be found on the major checksheet by visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.

Sullivan Web: www.finance.pamplin.vt.edu E-mail: fin@vt.eduOverview Finance is a specialty that works with the development, allocation and use of monetary resources within established legal and ethical frameworks, while understanding and mitigating the associated risks. Money is a critical component of the economic system and its flow is the sustaining force of the U.S. and global economy. Therefore, in working with how governments, corporations, intermediaries, and households utilize their financial assets finance professionals are an integral part of how the economy perpetuates the standard of living that we enjoy. Traditionally there are three separate but related fields within finance: 1) corporate financial management or \"business finance\" which focuses on the internal decisions of companies to raise funds and invest in corporate assets; 2) investment management which focuses on the purchase and sale of stocks and bonds or their derivatives by individuals and institutions; and 3) financial services management, which focuses on the management and regulation of institutions and the role that financial institutions play in the economy. The undergraduate program in Finance meets the requirements of students who desire specialized careers in financial management. Students gain expertise in both accounting and finance, essential for success as a financial professional. The case-oriented focus of coursework requires students to apply their knowledge and strengthen their oral and written communication skills. The department offers specializations in (i) Corporate Financial Management, (ii) Investment Management and CFA\u00a9 (Chartered Financial Analyst), based on the CFA\u00a9 curriculum as recognized and approved by the CFA Institute, (iii) Banking and Financial Institutions Management, (iv) Financial Accounting, and (v) CFP\u00a9 Certification Education with approval of CFP Board of Standards. Students also have the opportunity to participate in student management funds focused on investments in bonds (BASIS) and in stocks (SEED). The curriculum offers courses in finance, insurance, and business law, but a major only in finance. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply.

Oliver, Y. Shao, and S. Zick Instructors: J. D. Boyer, D. F. Carroll, S. Scales, and K. Stiles Career Advisors: M. Deisinger Web: www.geography.vt.edu Overview Geography offers a unique perspective on many of today's most important issues--from globalization, international development, and culture change to environmental problems, population growth, and climate change. Its theories and methods provide analytical techniques applicable to a wide range of questions significant to a broad spectrum of occupations. The geography major provides a balance between an education focusing on contemporary social, political, economic, and environmental issues and training in advanced computer-based techniques. Human geography is concerned with the spatial dimensions of human existence, the economy, politics, and culture as well as the relationshsips between humans and their environments. Physical geographers study patterns of climate, landforms, vegetation, soils, water, and natural hazardsand particularly the processes that produce those patterns, including human-environment interactions. Geospatial science involves Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), web services, and remote sensing. These technologies have led to significant advances in the ways in which geographic information is collected, mapped, analyzed, and integrated in database and decision- making systems. All students are exposed to these technologies as they are integral to working in the field today regardless of specialization and topic of interest. Training in geography provides valuable, marketable skills that are in high demand in business, government, and education. Geography majors obtain employment in such diverse fields as geographic information systems, satellite imagery analysis, planning, transportation, market analysis, health care analysis, cartography (map making), land and water management, recreation, and environmental conservation. Our students and graduates have worked with county, state, and federal agencies, privte firms, non-profit organizations, and international organizations. Employment opportunities are especially strong for students obtaining advanced training in geospatial computer techniques, which are used by both human and physical geographers. Geography Major Degree Requirements The department offers courses in human geography, physical geography, and geospatial information science. In addition to fulfilling the requirements of the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education), geography majors must also complete 48 hours in geography and related disciplines.

Watts Web: www.geos.vt.edu E-mail: geosciences@vt.eduOverview Geosciences offer exciting opportunities for students with an interest in applying a full range of science and mathematical skills to understand the earth's properties and dynamic processes. This is a highly interdisciplinary program that applies physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics to understand and manage all aspects of Earth and the environment. Geoscientists work everywhere in the world under almost any condition as they search for earth resources, manage the environment and natural hazards, and supervise technical and business enterprises. For more information about exciting careers in Geosciences consult http://about.agu.org/ and www.agiweb.org/careers.html. The extensive scientific and mathematical skills of geoscientists, along with their broad field experience, allow them to pursue careers in many related fields ranging from material science to technical management to scientific reporting. The internationally recognized faculty in Geosciences has developed four challenging options, described below, that lead to a B.S. in Geosciences. Coursework emphasizes the acquisition and processing of field data beginning with a special course in field methods taken in the spring of the first year. The geology option requires, and the other options recommend, that the student participate in a six-week field camp. The B.S. in Geosciences provides pre-professional preparation that will allow students to continue their education in post graduate programs in science, law, and business. Earth systems and processes are enormously complicated and require a full range of intellectual skills to decipher and manage. Geoscientists must possess good quantitative skills and a solid understanding of physics, chemistry, and biology. They must be able to read maps, identify rocks, minerals, and fossils as well as visualize earth structures in three dimensions. They must have strong communication skills, both written and verbal. Learning to use these skills in an integrated way is a challenging and rewarding experience. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Geology Option The Geology option offers a detailed coverage of the broad range of classic disciplines within the geosciences. This option emphasizes the study of minerals, rocks and fossils, and teaches the student how to understand the processes and history of the earth based on the occurrences and relationships of these materials at or near the Earth's surface. Geochemistry Option The Geochemistry option is designed for those students who have special interest in the chemical aspects of the Earth and its materials.Geophysics Option The Geophysics option offers the student the opportunity to specialize in the branch of the geosciences that investigates physical earth processes such as earthquakes and that images the interior of the earth through surface-based physical measurements. Earth Science Education Option The Earth Science education option provides students with a broad earth science curriculum that meets the content goals for secondary earth science teaching. Certification for Earth science teaching is not provided in the program. Information about teaching certification in Virginia can be obtained from the Department of Teaching and Learning.

Shelton Web: www.liberalarts.vt.edu/departments-and-schools/department-of-history.html Overview History is the study of people and events of the past to better understand how to meet the challenges of thefuture. Our students develop important 21st-century skills in research and analysis, speaking and writing excellence, the synthesis of diverse information, digital and media literacy, intercultural understanding, and historical/contextual expertise. Widely recognized for promoting undergraduate research, the history curriculum prepares students for fulfilling careers in the technology sector, law, business, the military, intelligence, non-profit management and administration, healthcare, media and communication, information management, and education. History also provides the knowledge and skill students need for graduate work in Journalism, Law, Business, and Medicine, or the liberal arts or social sciences. Courses at the 1000 level are introductory surveys open to anyone with an interest in history but without a strong background in the subject. Students intending to continue in history should take these courses in their freshman or sophomore years. Courses at the 2000 level, with the exception of Historical Methods, are broad surveys of particular topics for a general undergraduate audience. Courses at the 3000 level, primarily for sophomores and above, provide more focused and detailed study of a period, place, or topic introduced at the 1000 or 2000 level. Courses at the 4000 level are conducted as seminars that emphasize original writing and research, and are generally restricted to students with junior standing or above who have already taken six hours or more of college-level history. Majors The history curriculum is designed to introduce fundamental skills of the discipline, followed by upper division courses that develop knowledge and skills, culminating in a capstone experience. It is a deliberately flexible curriculum built to encourage students to double major, minor, or undertake study abroad, internships, or undergraduate research. History majors complete a minimum of 36 hours in History, including 18 hours of core history courses and 18 hours of depth studies that can be tailored to students' own interests. Majors who choose to undertake the Research/Thesis Option will complete the requirements of the B.A. in History and: six hours of undergraduate research that results in the completion of a Thesis, or three hours of undergraduate research that builds on work completed in HIST 4914 and three hours of History elective credit at the 2000 level or above. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Majors may select a concentration within the history major. Concentrations require that at least 12 of the 24 hours of history taken at the 2000 or 3000 level be appropriate to the field of concentration, and the completion of 6 hours of undergraduate research. Concentrations are available in: Military/Political/Diplomatic History; Social/Cultural/Economic History; Global/Comparative History; and History of Science/Technology/Environment. A faculty advisor and/or professional advisor will assist each major in planning a suitable course of study. The student is expected to confer with the faculty advisor at regular intervals regarding the progress of his or her studies.To earn a minor in history, a student must complete satisfactorily (with at least a 2.0 average) a minimum of 18 hours of history courses.

            "Values": "Overview Dietetics Science of Food, Nutrition, and Exercise Satisfactory Progress Undergraduate Course Descriptions (HNFE) Head: Matthew W. Hulver Professors: B. Davy, K. Davy, D. Liu, J. Rankin, E.L. Serrano, and J. Williams Associate Professors: D. Brown, D.J. Good, R.W. Grange, M. Hulver, E.M. Schmelz, and Y.H. Ju Assistant Professors: Z. Cheng, M. Frisard, S. Harden, V. Hedrick, V. Kraak, R. McMillian, and C. Rafie Senior Instructor: C.B. Papillon Advanced Instructor: H. Cox, R. Eaton, and N. Girmes-Grieco Instructors: K. Chang and M. Rockwell Adjunct Instructors: J. Gustafson, P. Ray, and W. Zuti Web: www.hnfe.vt.eduOverview Nutrition, foods, and exercise science is a unique field of study that builds on the biological and physical sciences. Human nutrition is directed toward helping people choose food that meets their physiological needs and is consistent with their lifestyles and cultural preferences. Changes in lifestyle and food consumption patterns have created consumer demand for new food products that are shelf stable, require little or no preparation, and are appropriate in nutrition content. These trends have increased the need for food professionals who wish to apply their science background to exploring the nutrient content and chemical and physical properties of foods and food ingredients. Increasing interest in physical fitness and wellness has brought about new professional opportunities in assisting people who want to develop appropriate exercise patterns and make healthy changes in their lifestyle. Many contemporary health issues including obesity, heart disease, and cancer have been associated with a person's food intake and level of exercise. This has led to increasing emphasis on health promotion and disease intervention, and the nutrition and exercise professionals are integral members of the health care team. Expanding research by private and government agencies focusing on the role of nutrition and physical activity in health, growth, and aging has created a demand for graduates at the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. levels who have a background and interest in laboratory and experimental methods in nutrition, foods and exercise science. The current interest in physical performance in our society has broadened the opportunities for combining expertise in nutrition with exercise and fitness for those with skills in counseling and entrepreneurship. Individuals with a background in food and nutrition are needed to help solve the problems of world hunger and food shortages, and the accompanying loss of human potential. There are two options from which an undergraduate student majoring in human nutrition, foods and exercise may choose: Dietetics or Science of Food, Nutrition and Exercise. The department participates in the University's Honors Program (see \"Academics\" in this catalog). The Department of Human Nutrition, Foods, and Exercise at Virginia Tech offers Master's and Doctoral degrees in three specialized areas as they relate to nutrition, physical activity, and health. Graduate students may earn a M.S. or a Ph.D. with an emphasis in Molecular and Cellular Science, Clinical Physiology and Metabolism, or Behavioral and Community Science. Degree RequirementsThe graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Dietetics Consult: Heather K. Cox The undergraduate Dietetics option, known as the Didactic Program in Dietetics (DPD), leads to a Bachelor of Science degree in Human Nutrition, Foods and Exercise. The dietetics option fulfills all academic course requirements for a Didactic Program in Dietetics according to the Standards of Education per the Accreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND). ACEND is the accrediting arm of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Following completion of the B.S. degree, a student has earned an ACEND Verification Statement. A student must then complete a supervised practice program (Dietetic Internship) to be eligible for the Registration Examination (RD) for Dietitians. The supervised practice requirement can be met through any ACEND accredited dietetic internship. Graduates with the B.S. in Dietetics are eligible to apply for the department's, or other, accredited Dietetic Internships. Registered Dietitians work in a variety of work settings. The dietetics program prepares you to assume a professional role in health care, research, the business environment or to pursue graduate studies. The dietetics program ultimately prepares you to assume a professional role in a health care, research, or business setting or to go on to graduate school. Clinical dietitians in hospitals and out-patient clinics provide care to individuals with disease-related nutritional problems. Community dietitians may work in health clubs specializing in sports nutrition, in work site wellness programs, or in community programs serving mothers and children, low-income families, or elderly people. Others work for food companies dealing with consumer questions about the nutrient content of food products, or with companies manufacturing nutritional supplements or other medical or health products. Administrative Dietitians with management or business interests find positions in food service management in health care facilities, work site, college, or university food service, or hotels and resorts. Registered Dietitians counsel people of all ages, cultural and ethnic backgrounds, and levels of education. Students in the Dietetics option must maintain an overall GPA of 3.0 to remain in this option. Students who want to change their major into the Dietetics option with HNFE must have an overall GPA of 3.0. Please see the Satisfactory Progress section for additional requirements. Science of Food, Nutrition, and Exercise Consult: Renee Eaton Upon completion of this option a student is well prepared for graduate work in any area of nutrition, exercise physiology or related sciences. This option also meets most admission requirements for medical, dental, physical therapy, pharmacy, physician assistant, athletic training and other health professions programs. This option allows students flexibility to tailor the degree toward long term goals which may lead to employment opportunities in research and development with a company manufacturing nutritional, health and exercise, or medical products, in the food industry in food product testing or quality control, in the health and fitness industry, or in a position related to clinical exercise physiology. Students in this option gain knowledge, skills, and abilities specified by the American College of Sports Medicinefor certification as a Certified Health Fitness Specialist. With the growing attention to the role of nutrition and exercise in health promotion and disease prevention, this option is especially appropriate for the student preparing for a career in medicine, physical therapy, or a related health field. The majority of students in the Science of Food, Nutrition and Exercise option plan to attend graduate or professional school. Students in the SFNE option do not meet the ACEND requirements for a degree in dietetics and therefore do not earn a Verification Statement. Students may choose to earn both the Dietetics and SFNE options in the department. Satisfactory Progress An HNFE student will be considered to have made satisfactory progress toward the degree when he/she has successfully completed: In-major GPA \u00e2?\u00a5 2.5 or higher. Overall GPA \u00e2?\u00a5 3.0 or higher (Dietetics option) or \u00e2?\u00a5 2.5 or higher (SNFE option) Grade of C or better in HNFE 1004, CHEM 1035, CHEM 1036 and CHEM 2535 or 2514. These courses must be completed by the time the student has attempted 72 hours: BIOL 1105-1106 or equivalent CHEM 1035-1036 or equivalent CHEM 2535 or 2514 HNFE 1004 Students not meeting Satisfactory Progress will have one probationary semester in which to resolve their standing. Restricted Major status: Current Virginia Tech students who wish to change majors into HNFE (or add as a 2nd major) will be required to have an overall GPA at or above 2.5 (3.0 for Dietetics and double option), have completed CHEM 1035 with a grades of C or higher, and create a plan of study that demonstrates how the student will attain Satisfactory Progress in regards to coursework. The GPA threshold of 2.5 (3.0 for Dietetics option) will stand for all students regardless of transfer status. Satisfactory progress towards degree is enforced.

Kennedy Professor of Practice: M. Sullivan Assistant Professors: J. Hauptman and E. Morshedzadeh Adjunct Professor: R. Reuter Professor Emeritus: R. Kemnitzer and E. Dorsa Web: www.industrialdesign.arch.vt.edu/ Overview As described by the Industrial Designers Society of America, \"Industrial Design (ID) is the professional service of creating and developing concepts and specifications that optimize the function, value and appearance of products and systems for the mutual benefit of both user and manufacturer. Industrial designers develop these concepts and specifications through collection, analysis and synthesis of data guided by the special requirements of the users, client and manufacturer. They are trained to prepare clear and concise recommendations through drawings, models and verbal descriptions. Industrial design services are often provided within the context of cooperative working relationships with other members of a development group. Typical groups include management, marketing, engineering and manufacturing specialists. The industrial designer expresses concepts that embody all relevant design criteria determined by the group.The industrial designer's unique contribution places emphasis on those aspects of the product or system that relate most directly to human characteristics, needs and interests. This contribution requires specialized understanding of visual, tactile, safety and convenience criteria, with concern for the user. Education and experience in anticipating psychological, physiological and sociological factors that influence and are perceived by the user are essential industrial design resources.\" The internationally recognized program at Virginia Tech, fully accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design, prepares individuals to enter this dynamic field through a rigorous curriculum and an experienced, dedicated faculty. Program Requirements Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula.

It emphasizes the role of international organizations in global economy and development as well as helping students to think critically about the globalization's impact on world economy, sustainable development and the fight against global poverty. Its purpose is to relate theory to practice and provide students with a breadth of knowledge and training in the various facets of sustainable international development and the sub-fields of governance and political economy, environment and development, and international public health. It seeks to prepare students for a fast-growing number and variety of careers in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of development programs, working for governments, international organizations, NGOs, and private companies. The International Relations (IREL) major focuses on the analysis of the political, societal, cultural, ethical, and normative aspects of international relations, as well as offering students a rigorous international and comparative perspective on the contemporary global system. It emphasizes a solid grounding in the methods of analysis used in the social sciences and humanities to help students think critically about international phenomena and analyze the choices and challenges that arise in this arena. It seeks to foster creative thinking about complex global problems and produce very competitive graduates and enlightened citizens who would possess the necessary knowledge and skills that would allow them not only to successfully pursue careers in their chosen field but, most importantly, serve their communities and the nation. The International Studies (IS) major offers an opportunity to learn about foreign cultures, religions, languages, economics, and history. The curriculum is interdisciplinary in orientation and is designed to introduce students to a variety of important approaches for understanding the international scene. Whether or not students will pursue careers directly related to world affairs, the understanding gained in this major will provide a much broader perspective of the world and the United States' place in it. This major makes use of courses in economics, geography, foreign languages, history, religion and culture, sociology, and other disciplines. The National Security and Foreign Affairs (NSFA) major offers students expertise and understanding of the broad range of threats to national and global security in the 21st century and equips them with the necessary knowledge and skills that would allow them to successfully pursue careers in diplomacy and international organizations. The National Security and Foreign Affairs (NSFA) major analyzes the role of diplomacy in the management of world affairs and examines in-depth U.S. grand strategy and foreign policy; the current and future global geopolitical environment that affect the U.S. and its interests; the ends, ways, and means that impact the use of military force; the informational issues that contribute to the holistic implementation of strategy, and counterterrorism and homeland security. It is designed to connect theory to practice thereby providing a hands-on, practical approach to the field that would equip students with the tools to analyze threats that challenge U.S. security both at home and abroad. Please see http://liberalarts.vt.edu/academics/majors-and-minors/international-studies-major.html for more information.Major Requirements The curriculum is designed to provide foundational and development courses, major-specific study, and a capstone experience. Students are introduced to concepts early in the undergraduate career, and the curriculum allows them to build knowledge and skills as they work on increasingly complex tasks. They also develop skills in written, spoken, and visual communication across their studies in the major. At the foundational level, students in every major are required to take the same introductory courses. Then students move into one of four majors, and later they come back together in the senior year to work on a capstone experience. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula.

Adopting an experiential learning approach, this minor seeks to encourage and reward Virginia Tech students who wish to explore and study the \"international\" through a variety of educational tools, such as study abroad, in-class simulations, participation in various international organizations models (e.s., Model UN, Model NATO, Model OAS), field studies, undergraduate research, internships and externships, and educational programs and engagement opportunities offered by U.S. national federal agencies and other organizations, such as the Department of State (e.s., Diplomacy Lab and Foreign Policy Classroom), the Council of Foreign Relations, and the U.S. Institute for Peace. The minor in International Public Policy (IPPL) is designed for students who wish to develop the analytical and leadership skills necessary to formulate and advocate policy on key international issues. It seeks to provide students with a detailed and systematic understanding of how political institutions, processes, and public policies operate in world affairs. The program brings together the academic study of international relations with analysis of public policy formulation and governance beyond the nation- state. The program seeks to prepare students for a fast-growing number and variety of careers in the planning, implementation, and evaluation of development programs, working for governments, international organizations, NGOs, and private companies.The minor in International Relations (IREL) is designed to offer students a rigorous international and comparative perspective on the contemporary global system. It focuses on the changing political and cultural relations within the international system in the modern era, exploring how global, regional, and domestic factors influence relations between actors on the world stage. Students are equipped with both the foundational skills and specific knowledge necessary to analyze the choices and challenges that arise in this arena. The program seeks to provide a hands-on, practical approach to the field that would equip students with the analytic tools, language expertise, and cross-cultural understanding necessary to pursue successful careers in government, Foreign Service, and international organizations. The minor in International Studies (IS) offers students an interdisciplinary approach to the study of global affairs. The purpose of the program is threefold: first, to supplement the knowledge and skills that students have acquired through their major field of study with knowledge about the global political and economic system and the global forces and processes that shape our daily lives; second, to further students' critical and analytical skills; and third, to create knowledgeable and enlightened citizens and global leaders. The minor in National Security and Foreign Affairs (NSFA) analyzes the role of diplomacy in the management of world affairs and provides a hands-on, practical approach to security analysis that would equip students with the tools to analyze threats that challenge US security both at home and abroad. The program seeks to supplement the knowledge and skills that students have acquired through their major field of study with expertise and understanding of the broad range of threats to national and global security in the 21st century, as well as to equip students with the necessary knowledge and skills that would allow them to successfully pursue careers in diplomacy and international organizations.

The Industrial and Systems Engineering program at Virginia Tech is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org. Curriculum The ISE curriculum explicitly encompasses coursework useful in addressing not only the technical elements of work systems, but also the organizational, economic, and human elements. Our aim is to provide graduates with the knowledge and capabilities to enable them to successfully pursue careers in industrial engineering or, if qualified, to continue on to graduate study. ISE emphasizes instruction in fundamental engineering principles based on the physical sciences, engineering sciences, mathematics, and statistics. These principles are applied in practical design experiences throughout the undergraduate curriculum. Course work in the physical and chemical sciences and mathematics provides a solid background for basic engineering science courses, which in turn support more focused courses in industrial engineering, covering topics in operations research, manufacturing systems engineering, human factors engineering and ergonomics, and management systems engineering. In all these areas, analysis and design activities are supported by modern computing and software tools taught in the curriculum. Students gain valuable hands-on experience in multiple areas of our curriculum in state-of-the-art laboratory facilities associated with the undergraduate program. These include the ISE Computer Laboratory, which contains computers and printers to support the needs and requirements of ISE students that are not available through access to personal computers or in other laboratories; the Senior Design Center, with computer support and other resource material for student design projects; the Harris Manufacturing Processes Laboratories, which contain robotics and automation equipment, machining equipment, conventional and numerically controlled machine tools, and welding and foundry facilities; the Human Factors Work Measurement and Methods Engineering Laboratory, which is equipped and usedfor in-class exercises and experiments in work measurement, motion economy and time study, psychophysics, human audition and vision, and work station design. Students also have the opportunity to work on Undergraduate Research with faculty and graduate students in the many ISE research labs and groups. The capstone course in the ISE Undergraduate Program is a two-semester class, ISE 4005-6 Project Management & System Design (also referred to as \"Senior Design\"), where students work in project teams with an external company sponsor to solve a real-world problem. This experience provides ISE students with actual project experience that develops technical and professional skills, such as teamwork, communication, project management, and life-long learning skills, in addition to developing capabilities in applying IE tools and techniques. Student project teams present their project findings at our annual Senior Design Symposium attended by company sponsors and the ISE Advisory Board. For the 2019 graduation requirements, the course work totals 133 hours. Electives provide students with the opportunity to explore other areas of engineering, as well as cultural, societal and creative experiences, which makes for a well-rounded, diverse, and globally-aware engineer. The ISE program also provides students with the opportunity to pursue minors, such as a Business Minor, Green Engineering Minor, or Statistics Minor. More specific information about minors available to ISE students can be found in the ISE Undergraduate Student Handbook, posted on the ISE web site. Students and employers alike are seeing the benefits of these minors for adding value to the ISE major. Many ISE students seek to participate in Undergraduate Research to satisfy elective requirements in the curriculum. The opportunity to work more closely, in some cases on a one-on-one basis, with our outstanding faculty can provide more in-depth development of ISE capabilities and a more enriching educational experience. The department participates in the Cooperative Education & Internship Program, in which qualified students may alternate semesters of study with semesters of professional co-op employment or internships. Students are encouraged to pursue these experiences before they graduate to make them more competitive in the work force. Students are also encouraged to participate in career fairs and job interviews on and off campus. The ISE department also provides students with many significant scholarship opportunities at the undergraduate and graduate levels to encourage and acknowledge high academic performance and achievements. The ISE department also maintains bilateral student exchange agreements with international universities, where students can take ISE courses which will transfer back to their BSISE. Students may also select other universities at which to perform a study abroad semester. Graduate programs leading to the M.S. and Ph.D. are offered (see Graduate Catalog). The graduate programs include concentrations in manufacturing systems engineering, human factors engineering and ergonomics, operations research, management systems engineering, and general IE. The ISE Department also coordinates on- and off-campus master's degree programs in systems engineering (M.S.) and engineering administration (M.E.A.). Program Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Graduation requirements are referred to via university publications known as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at https://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Students are strongly encouraged to meet with one of the ISE Academic Advisors to discuss the BSISE curriculum.

Renard, and B. Whitney Assistant Professors: M. Wagner and E. Tural Associate Professor Emeritus: B. Parsons Web: www.archdesign.vt.edu/interior-design/ Overview The interior design program at Virginia Tech is dedicated to improving quality of life through design excellence, professionalism, and public service. With a curriculum that equally respects the importance of creative skill, history, building technology, ethics, innovation, and business practice, our graduates have the ability and confidence needed to immediately contribute to the profession. Students in the interior program begin their studies in the foundation design laboratory during the first two semesters with architecture, landscape architecture and industrial design students. From the beginning, both an independent and team approach to design solutions is encouraged. In their professional studies students are challenged to think critically in their design of space and to develop solutions that not only enhance quality of life, but also protect the health, safety, and welfare of users as prescribed in the various codes and regulations that govern the work of interior designers. This philosophy is the core of our program. It establishes a foundation upon which each student graduateswith creative ingenuity and professional responsibility. Our CIDA accredited program prepares future designers for licensure and practice. A degree from a CIDA accredited program is increasingly important as a requirement for professional certification and licensing of Interior Designers in the United States. Graduating from a CIDA accredited program is the first step in a three-part process in achieving certification or licensing as an interior designer in various states. The last two steps are to complete two years of assistantship as an interior designer and then passing the National Council for Interior Design Qualification (NCIDQ) examination. A CIDA accredited degree, work experience and passing the NCIDQ exam satisfy the requirements in Virginia for recognition as a \"Certified Interior Designer.\" Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Satisfactory Progress University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\") and toward the degree in Urban Affairs and Planning.

Hill, and B. Johnson Professor Emeritus: B. Johnson Web: www.lar.vt.eduOverview Landscape Architecture encompasses the design, analysis, planning, management, and stewardship of sustainable environments. Landscape architects design across a wide spectrum of projects: parks and gardens, community design, urban design and planning, green infrastructure, and regional planning, as well as at the scale of watersheds and natural systems. The work of the profession is grounded in the natural and social sciences, draws inspiration from nature and the arts, and is implemented through innovative design, site engineering, construction, land management, and environmental technologies. The Landscape Architecture Program guides students as they address some of the most important challenges of our time: climate change; healthy living and empathetic design; urbanization; re-imagining water, food, energy and transportation; green infrastructure; remediation of spoiled and disturbed sites; and preserving critical natural resources. We believe the work of the profession, at the critical intersection of natural and cultural systems, will be the most consequential of the design arts in the 21st century. The core of the academic program is a rigorous sequence of design studios that allows students to explore a broad range of landscape architectural issues, contexts, and project types. Studios are accompanied by discussion, lecture, and laboratory courses that provide systematic and comprehensive coverage of the emerging body of knowledge related to technology, design theory, landscape ecology, and human/environment interaction. Off-campus options include a summer travel studio, study at the Washington Alexandria Architecture Center, and exchange programs with Tongji University in Shanghai, or University College, Dublin, Ireland, as well as an independent semester abroad and professional internships. The Bachelor of Landscape Architecture (B.L.A.) is a five year first-professional degree program fully accredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board of the American Society of Landscape Architects. Graduates have a wide range of employment and professional opportunities including work in private practice, multidisciplinary firms, public agencies and municipalities, non-government organizations and non-profits.

Kim Web: www.math.vt.edu Overview Mathematics is essential to a clear and complete understanding of virtually all phenomena. Its precision, depth, and generality support the development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills. The study of mathematics provides the ability to describe applied problems quantitatively and to analyze these problems in a precise and logical manner. This is a principal reason behind the strong demand for mathematicians in government and industry. Essentially all complex problems, whether physical, social, or economic, are solved by designing a mathematical model, analyzing the model, and determining computational algorithms for an efficient and accurate approximation of a solution. Each of these phases is mathematical in nature. For example, if a problem deviates from a standard form, a mathematician should be able to adjust the usual mathematical treatment of the problem to accommodate the deviation. In this case mathematical training provides a practical preparation for a career in today's changing world. Moreover, it is especially valuable because it is an education that equips one to continue to adapt to new situations. Mathematicians typically are employed as applied mathematicians in their specialty areas. Our recent mathematics graduates have been approximately equally divided among government and industry, graduate school, and teaching. There are four different paths or options that a student may follow towards a B.S. in Mathematics: 1) the Traditional Option; 2) the Applied Computational Mathematics Option (ACM); 3) the Applied Discrete Mathematics Option (ADM); and 4) the Mathematics Education Option (MSTR). The Traditional Option, as its name implies, yields a broad and flexible background in mathematics. The other three options are more specialized. The ACM option is designed for students primarily interested in computational mathematics and its applications to engineering and the natural and social sciences. The ADM option is designed for students primarily interested in areas of applied mathematics closely associated with computer science. The Mathematics Education Option is designed for students who want to be certified to teach secondary mathematics. Often students will begin their studies in the Traditional Option and later change to one of the other three options when they become more sure of the path they wish to pursue. One, however, can acquire many aspects of the three specialized options within the Traditional Option, because it also requires some degree of specialization in an applications area and provides career development features. The three specialized options are each less general, but bring particular career paths into sharper focus. Each of the four options provides an excellent foundation for graduate study, either in mathematics or in an applications area. Handbooks for each of the options, as well as mathematics career information, are available upon request. Approximately $45,000 in Hatcher, Morris, Layman, Rollins, Steeneck, Caldwell, Wells, Oehring, Eckert, Persinger, Kim, Kimball, and Roselle scholarships is awarded annually to mathematics majors at Virginia Tech: $5,000 for incoming freshmen and $40,000 for continuing undergraduates. Information on the scholarships is available from the scholarship chairman in mathematics.The Cooperative Education Program is also available to qualified candidates, and students wishing to mix practical experience with their formal course studies are encouraged to investigate this option. For more information, contact Career Services at Virginia Tech. The Mathematics Department firmly believes that mathematics is not only useful and beautiful, but also fun. The department sponsors student chapters of MAA (Mathematical Association of America), SIAM (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics), Pi Mu Epsilon (the national mathematics honorary society), and AWM (Association for Women in Mathematics). As well as social activities, these groups sponsor speakers to talk on how mathematics is used in their work. Each fall, Virginia Tech also sponsors the Virginia Tech Regional Mathematics Contest. In addition, students (not all of whom are mathematics majors) annually receive organized preparation and compete in the nationwide William Lowell Putnam Competition and the international Mathematical Contest in Modeling. Individual undergraduate research projects are available to talented students, and a Layman Prize is awarded for the best research project. An overall outstanding senior, as well as an outstanding senior for each option, is recognized each year. The Honors Program in Mathematics provides outstanding undergraduate majors the opportunity for an enriched academic environment. Through honors courses, an honors project, individual association with the faculty and honors advisors, and other perquisites, the honors student in mathematics enjoys a valuable advantage in the undergraduate experience. Moreover, in coordination with the head of Mathematics and the dean of Science, the honors student may design her/his own individual set of graduation requirements. In addition to the four undergraduate-degree options, the department also offers the M.S. and Ph.D. Moreover, for qualified students, a combined program is available that leads to both a B.S. and an M.S. in Mathematics. This program saves a year from the usual time required for a B.S. and an M.S. done separately. Students in the Education Option obtain a B.S. in Math and an M.A. in Education by completing four years of undergraduate study and a fifth year in education for a full secondary certification. The minor is designed to provide recognition for those students who take a program of study in mathematics above the normal requirements of their disciplines. Bachelor of Science in Mathematics Requirements Note that the Calculus curriculum is in transition and there are two possible paths through Calculus. We distinguish the two paths as follows: Path 1 for students who have received credit for MATH 1205 prior to fall 2014 and Path 2 for students who have not received credit for MATH 1205 prior to fall 2014. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Those courses listed in the catalog under the subtitles \"Basic Sequences for Students in Agriculture, Architecture, Biology, Business, and Liberal Arts and Human Sciences\" and \"Electives (may not be taken by Mathematics Majors)\" may not be used for graduation in mathematics. Special exceptions to thisexclusion must have the approval of the head of the department of mathematics. In order to enroll in 3034, a student must obtain a C or better in MATH 2114 or obtain a C or better MATH 2114H or obtain a C or better in MATH 2405H. Each student is required to participate in the department's Outcomes Assessment procedures as determined by each year's Undergraduate Program Committee and approved by the department head. Prospective Student Website A great deal of further information on the Mathematics Program and on mathematical careers can be found on our website at www.math.vt.edu.

Sanders (Air Force Research Lab) Web: www.me.vt.edu Nature of the Profession Mechanical engineering is the broadest of the engineering professions. Because of the breadth of the ME discipline, mechanical engineers work in a wide variety of technical areas and are employed in a range of job functions. Specialty areas within the mechanical engineering discipline include, among many others, acoustics, biomechanics, CAD, controls, energy conversion and energy management, HVAC, materials, mechanical design, mechatronics, nuclear engineering, robotics and automation, and turbomachinery. The actual job functions which mechanical engineers perform vary widely as well. ME's work in design, research and development, manufacturing, service and maintenance, as well as technical sales, in almost every industry. Many are in management and administration. Many mechanical engineering graduates go on to more advanced degrees, or continue their education in other fields, such a law or business. Employment Opportunities Because of the diversity and breadth of the mechanical engineering profession, ME graduates find employment in a wide variety of industries, laboratories, and consulting firms. This results in a relatively stable job market that is not dependent upon a single particular industry. The textile, petroleum, chemical, electronic, automotive, aerospace, power generation, HVAC, and manufacturing industries hire large numbers of mechanical engineering graduates and the starting salaries for ME's are very competitive with the other engineering disciplines. Because of the wide diversity of specialties and job functions any two mechanical engineers might have significantly different day-to-day activities and responsibilities. Some may be concerned with very large engineering systems while others are working with small and even microscale devices and components; some work might call for highly analytical or mathematical approaches while other work might be more amenable to experimental or empirical approaches. Mechanical engineers may be involved in the operation of processing plants, or the design of engines, prosthetic devices, steam and gas turbines or compressors and pumps, alternative fuel devices, and many other devices and systems. At Virginia Tech there is a close association between the ME departments research and design project activities with industry. This enhances the opportunities for student interaction with industry representatives. Mechanical Engineering Program Educational Objectives Within a few years after graduating from the Mechanical Engineering Department at Virginia Tech, the graduates will attain: Positions where they utilize fundamental technical knowledge and skills in mathematics, science, and engineering to analyze and solve problems, and apply these abilities to generate new knowledge, ideas or products in academia, industry or government. Practical experience and organizational skills, enabling them to interact and communicate effectively(written and/or oral) with others (e.g., supervisor, client and/or team) with regard to the diversity of the stakeholders involved in their work. Roles of increasing responsibility leading to leadership positions that benefit themselves, their employers and society. Skills in life-long learning through: (a) self-study, (b) continuing education/short courses or workshops, and/or (c) formal graduate level education, as well as skills to motivate and encourage co-workers to also pursue lifelong learning. Roles in professional and personal life where they demonstrate professional and ethical responsibilities toward peers, employers, and society and follow these precepts in their daily lives. Program Outcomes We expect our students to have the following skills, knowledge, and behaviors by the time of their graduation. We want our students to obtain: An ability to identify, formulate, and solve complex engineering problems by applying principles of engineering, science, and mathematics. An ability to apply the engineering design process to produce solutions that meet specified needs with consideration for public health and safety, and global, cultural, social, environmental, economic, and other factors as appropriate to the discipline. An ability to develop and conduct appropriate experimentation, analyze and interpret data, and use engineering judgment to draw conclusions. An ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences. An ability to recognize ethical and professional responsibilities in engineering situations and make informed judgments, which must consider the impact of engineering solutions in global, economic, environmental, and societal contexts. An ability to recognize the ongoing need to acquire new knowledge, to choose appropriate learning strategies, and to apply this knowledge. An ability to function effectively as a member or leader of a team that establishes goals, plans tasks, meets deadlines, and creates a collaborative and inclusive environment. The Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering (BSME) degree program at Virginia Tech is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org. The department is committed to providing students with an exceptional experience in both the theory and practice of mechanical engineering. In the senior capstone sequence students are required to apply classroom knowledge to complex engineering problems requiring teamwork, problem formulation, economic analysis, effective communication, and product realization. These projects are carefully selected and updated to ensure relevancy to contemporary technical issues and needs. The department encourages the involvement of underclassmen and students outside the department and college in these projects. The department also encourages hands-on student involvement by providing dedicated machine and welding shops that exclusively serve the undergraduate program. The required sophomore-level Manufacturing Processes Laboratory course and certification by a professional machinist are required prior to use of either of these shops. Opportunity for professional development is provided by participation in student professional organizations, such as the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, ASME, and the American Nuclear Society, ANS. The Curriculum A total of 131 semester credits are required for graduation. Please refer to the Registrar's website for official program checksheets showing the graduation requirements and recommended course plans. A revised ME curriculum is currently in preparation. Students should check the ME website or speak with one of the ME undergraduate advisers for the latest information regarding the proposed curriculum changes. For the currently approved curriculum unofficial documents are available on the ME website showing prerequisite relationships to courses and alternative course plans (e.g. for co-op students and military 4.5 and 5-year plans).www.me.vt.edu/academic-programs/undergraduate-program/current-students/course- selection/#requiredcourses The ME curriculum provides a strong foundation in the basic physical and chemical sciences and in mathematics. These are followed by a sequence of courses that provide a broad background in design methodology, computer programming, electronics, solid and fluid mechanics, manufacturing processes, system modeling, machine design, thermodynamics, heat and mass transfer, statistics and materials. Courses in English and in the humanities and social sciences are included to broaden the individual. This background is strengthened and unified through a sequence of engineering design and laboratory courses. Instructional laboratories in the junior and senior years provide opportunities for students to learn measurement and instrumentation techniques. Students apply these skills to the acquisition and analysis of data from various engineering systems. In all professional endeavors the mechanical engineer must consider ecological effects as well as the economic and social needs of people. The mechanical engineer must consider the conservation of natural resources and the environmental impact in the design of systems. These considerations are included in a number of ME courses and technical elective classes. Students wishing to further strengthen this area may wish to consider the Green Engineering Option at www.eng.vt.edu/green/index.php. The unifying activity in all aspects of mechanical engineering is the design function. A special emphasis has been placed on the use of computer-aided design methods and applied design project experience as a required part of the curriculum. Elective courses in the junior and senior years provide students with the opportunity to pursue specialized interests related to career plans or preparation for graduate study. The department participates in the Cooperative Education Program in which qualified students may alternate semesters of study with semesters of professional employment. Approximately twenty percent of all mechanical engineering students participate in this program. Education Abroad Programs The Department of Mechanical Engineering is a world leader in providing high-quality education abroad opportunities to its students and preparing them to function effectively as true global engineers. The cornerstone of this strategy is the Ultimate Global Engineer Program, which identifies three major windows of opportunity for students to attend topflight mechanical engineering programs abroad and graduate on time. Students can select to participate in any combination of one, two, or even all three of these windows of opportunity: Windows #1: Fall semester sophomore year in a country where the language of instruction is English. Currently students can attend the University of Melbourne, the top-ranked mechanical engineering program in Australia. Windows #2: Rising junior summer in a country with a non-English language but where the language of instruction is English. Currently students can attend Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the top-ranked mechanical engineering program in China. This program is particularly well suited for students that need to catch up on their course work, reduce their junior-year course load, or get ahead on their course work. Windows #3: Senior year abroad in a country with a non-English language but where the language of instruction is non-English. Currently students can attend the Technische Universit\u00e4t Darmstadt (TUD), the top- ranked mechanical engineering program in Germany. Language training is integrated into the curriculum, starting as late as spring semester junior year. For more information about these and other exiting education abroad programs offered by the Department of Mechanical Engineering, please visit: http://www.me.vt.edu/international http://www.tud.vt.edu/BS Entrance RequirementThe College of Engineering at Virginia Tech limits the number of students who may transfer into any particular department, with that number based upon the number of faculty in each separate department. Refer to the Engineering Education website at www.enge.vt.edu for the latest information on transferring into the ME department. The ME academic advisor may also be consulted for information on anticipated entrance requirement changes. Satisfactory Progress University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimum criteria toward the Curriculum for Liberal Education (recently replaced with Pathways General Education Curriculum), and toward the degree in mechanical engineering. Satisfactory progress toward a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering includes the following minimum criteria: Complete a minimum of 12 credits that apply toward the BSME each year maintain an in-major GPA (all ME and NSEG courses) of at least a 2.0 maintain an extended in-major GPA of at least 2.0 (in all ME, NSEG courses plus ESM 2104, 2204, and 2304). complete ESM 2104, Math 2114 and Math 2204 within 45 attempted required course credits (not to include CLE courses, technical electives or free electives) complete ESM 2304, ME 2124, and Math 2214 within 60 attempted required course credits (not to include CLE courses, technical electives, or free electives) complete ME 3124, ME 3514 and ME 3614 within 72 attempted required course credits (not to include CLE courses, technical electives, or free electives) complete ME 4006, ME 4015 and ME 4124 within 90 attempted required course credits (not to include CLE courses, technical electives, or free electives) complete any required course in the ME curriculum within two or feer attempts The department offers graduate programs leading to the M.S., M.Eng., and Ph.D. in mechanical engineering (see the Graduate Catalog). The Department of Mechanical Engineering actively seeks input on the nature and quality of our program from all interested individuals and organizations, including students, employers and supporting agencies. Our goal is to provide the best possible service to the students who entrust their education to us. Through our continuous improvement efforts, we pledge to continually improve the content of our curriculum, our educational methods and our facilities. Comments to the department head or any member of the faculty are welcomed.

The mission of the department is to produce high quality, rigorously trained mining engineers, whose background and education reflect the current level of technology and thought of the profession, and who can enter directly into engineering practice or, alternatively, graduate school for further study. Specifically, the Department of Mining and Minerals Engineering seeks, as its educational objectives, to prepare alumni within a few years of graduation to possess: the intellectual ability to critically assess and tackle any engineering problem they may encounter; the communication skills to communicate technical information to a variety of audiences including technically trained supervisors and subordinates as well as non-technical members of the work force and the general public; the leadership and team building skills to lead projects and function as entry-level managers as well as work productively as members of a team; an understanding of the practical aspects of the mining industry and an appreciation for mining as a business; and an awareness of societal issues and how these issues affect their role as future professional engineers working for the general benefit of society. The mining engineering curriculum utilizes the basic and engineering sciences to develop the various areas of activity of the mining engineer: mineral exploration, evaluation, development, extraction, mineral processing, conservation, protection of the environment, and mineral economics. Course work in these areas provides a unique background for engineering and management positions in industry and government, as well as for continuation of specialized graduate studies. Intrinsic to the curriculum is the development of a meaningful, major engineering design experience that builds upon the fundamental concepts of mathematics, basic sciences, the humanities and social sciences, engineering topics, and communication skills. This design experience is stressed within the major and grows with the development and progression of the student. Ethical, social, safety, economic, and environmental considerations are emphasized in the design experience throughout many courses, including the capstone senior design course. Finally, the major engineering design experience is a focal point of the mining engineering curriculum and is consistent with the objectives and goals of the program. The program has an emphasis on the application of computers to mining and minerals processing operations. Furthermore, it exposes students to laboratory courses which focus on conducting experiments, understanding the principles involved in each experiment, and analyzing and interpreting experimental data. Information on the mission, goals, and curriculum of the program is continuously updated on the departmental website. The Cooperative Education Program, as well as opportunities for financial support in the form of scholarships, loans, awards, and summer employment, are available to undergraduate and graduate students.

Web: www.marketing.pamplin.vt.eduOverview Marketing grows out of the concept of exchange between buyers and sellers. Driven by the needs and wants of the consumer, marketing managers develop new products, assign effective price levels, create promotional strategies, and develop the best distribution plans to guarantee that products reach the final consumer. Marketing also plays a crucial role in managing the efficient flow of goods and services from businesses to businesses. And managing marketing is growing even more exciting as technology and the internet enable managers to stay in closer contact with their customers and better manage this relationship. Marketing by manufacturing firms is well-known. Service industries such as banking and health care, however, are increasingly relying on marketing to improve service quality and delivery. Non- profit organizations, such as Habitat for Humanity and the American Red Cross, also use marketing to deliver social goods and services. All of these organizations benefit when they are able to use marketing concepts and tools to better understand their clients and design unique offerings that can meet their clients' needs. The undergraduate program in marketing management is designed to offer the student a broad business education with an emphasis on professional training for development of marketing strategies and managing marketing operations. Virginia Tech Marketing graduates pursue a range of careers. They take jobs in marketing management, sales, advertising, retailing, and consulting positions in companies small and large. The curriculum is designed to provide core skills in marketing and to support this broad range of potential career interests. In addition to the undergraduate program, the faculty in marketing management offer a master's and a doctoral degree for those students interested in more technical positions, such as marketing research; more rapid promotion with certain employers; or positions in higher education. The department participates in the Cooperative Education Program in which qualified students may alternate semesters of study with semesters of professional employment. The Marketing Department currently offers three degree options: Marketing- no concentration, Marketing- Sales concentration, and Marketing- Digital Marketing Strategy Concentration. In addition to the major, Marketing offers minors in Professional Sales and Digital Marketing Strategy to non-Marketing majors within the College of Business only.The Professional Sales concentration and minor provide students with the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully enter the field of professional sales.

Thomas Advisor: (540) 231-6401 Web: www.armyrotc.vt.edu Overview The Department of Military Science provides a program of leadership development which prepares college men and women for service as officers in the United States Army. After graduation, they serve as commissioned officers on active duty, or as officers in reserve forces units. To accomplish this, the department: Prepares cadets to be commissioned as Second Lieutenants through a curriculum which develops leadership skills, and provides opportunities to utilize these skills in a variety of practical applications. Provides an understanding of how to lead and influence small organizations, with a strong emphasis on personal integrity, critical thinking, ethical decision making, goal setting, and mission accomplishment. Offers adventure training, such as rappelling, land-navigation, marksmanship, and, for selected students, airborne, air assault, combat diver training. Army sponsored international programs for cultural awareness and language training as well as internships with active army units and federal agencies worldwide are also offered during the summer. In conjunction with the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets, provides programs and experiences which increase self-confidence, self-discipline, physical stamina, poise, and other attributes essential to thedevelopment of a leader of character--one who is prepared to serve the nation or the commonwealth both in or out of uniform. The curriculum and leader development programs of the Department of Military Science are mentally and physically challenging. Cadets learn individual soldier skills and undergo physical conditioning, beginning in the freshman year. On-campus instruction is done both in the classroom and in the field environment. Lab training and leadership development exercises expand the general knowledge of cadets and provide opportunities for practical leadership experience. Summer leadership training occurs after either the freshman or sophomore year as well as between the junior and senior years at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Army ROTC offers the conventional four-year program where a student enters as a freshman. A three-year program for sophomores is also available. Additionally, a two-year program is offered for juniors and graduate students. Placement credit may be awarded to students with ROTC experience, students currently serving in the Army Reserve or National Guard, those who have had active military service, or those who volunteer for summer training at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Scholarships covering full tuition and fees are available for entering freshman though a High School National Army ROTC Scholarship Board process. Applications for these scholarships are available on-line at www.goarmy.com/rotc. Otherwise, Cadets enrolled in Army ROTC can compete for Campus Based scholarships through the department's Recruiting Operations Officer. All contracted Cadets (scholarship or non-scholarship) enrolled in the junior and senior years of ROTC are paid a tax-free stipend of $450.00 for ten months during their junior year and $500 for ten months during their senior year for a total of $9,500.00. Membership in the Virginia Tech Corps of Cadets is a pre-requisite for all ROTC classes. The cost of cadet uniforms is paid by a special Army uniform allowance provided to each enrolled cadet. Minor in Leadership Studies Satisfactory completion of the 20-credit military science curriculum may qualify each cadet for a minor in leadership studies. Virginia Tech is the first land-grant university in the nation to recognize the military science curricula with the award of a leadership studies minor.

These materials include ceramics, metals, polymers, composites, biomaterials, nanomaterials, semiconductors, and electronic, magnetic, and photonic materials. Materials engineers develop new materials, improve traditional materials, and manufacture materials economically through synthesis, processing, and fabrication. They seek to understand physical and chemical phenomena in material structures and to measure and characterize materials properties of all kinds including mechanical, electrical, optical, magnetic, thermal, and chemical. They predict and evaluate the performance of materials as structural or functional elements in engineering systems and structures. They assist engineers in other disciplines and architects in selecting optimal materials for various applications. Significant opportunities exist for graduates in the aerospace, automobile, transportation, medical, microelectronics, telecommunications, chemical, petroleum, energy storage, power generation, and energy conservation industries, as well as within the basic industries producing materials--for example, the copper, aluminum, steel, ceramics, glass, and polymer industries. Opportunities also exist in government-operated engineering centers and research laboratories. Graduates work in entry level engineering, manufacturing, materials selection and design, quality assurance and control, research and development, technical consulting, management, and sales and marketing. Graduates have an excellent background for post-graduate studies in science, engineering, medicine, law, and business. Program Educational Objectives and Student Outcomes Educational Objectives The goal of the BS degree program in MSE is to provide the educational foundation that enables alumni to pursue their personal career objectives. Historically, the majority of our alumni become valued members of industrial and/or research teams within the field of materials science or related technical disciplines while a smaller percentage pursue graduate education or other personal career objectives. The specific objectives for the BS degree program in MSE are to produce alumni who are: effective communicators with written, oral, and visual media: able to apply critical thinking skills to engineering and research problems: and effective learners able to apply new technical tools, techniques, and knowledge specific to their field of employment or graduate studies. Student Outcomes Upon graduation, students completing the B.S. degree program in MSE will be able to: General Outcomes (A) apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering (B) design and conduct experiments, as well as analyze and interpret data (C) design a system, component, or process to meet desired needs within realistic constraints such as economic, environmental, societal, global, political, ethical, health and safety, manufacturability, and sustainability (D) function on multidisciplinary teams while maintaining independent thought and expression(E) identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems (F) understand professional and ethical responsibility (G) communicate effectively (H) understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global economic, environmental, and societal context (I) recognize the need for, and to engage in, lifelong learning (J) apply knowledge of contemporary issues (K) use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice Materials Specific Outcomes (L) apply advanced science (such as chemistry and physics) and engineering principles to materials systems/problems (M) understand the scientific and engineering principles underlying the four major elements of the field: structure, properties, processing, and performance (N) apply and integrate knowledge from each of the above four elements of the field to solve materials selection and design problems (O) utilize experimental, statistical, and computational methods consistent with the program educational objectives. Curriculum Students typically enter the MSE Department following completion of their first year studies within the College of Engineering, as administered by the Department of Engineering Education (EngE); a description of required first year coursework can be found within the EngE section of this catalog. In addition to foundation courses in MSE, students tailor an individualized program of elective study. Fifteen credits of technical electives will be selected to emphasize certain subdisciplines of MSE (e.g., metals, ceramics, polymers, electronic materials, composites, biomaterials, nanomaterials, etc.) or to prepare for a career in certain application areas (e.g., manufacturing, aerospace, automotive, information technology, microelectronics, etc.). Course-work totals 131 credit hours as detailed on the BS in MSE checksheet which can be found at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html. Students expecting to graduate beyond the displayed checksheet years should use the last projected term until the checksheet for that calendar year becomes available. The undergraduate curriculum contains a nationally recognized integrated program of instruction in engineering communication including writing, public speaking, proposal preparation, reporting, research skills, critical and creative thinking, and graphical presentation. More information regarding this unique program can be found at http://www.mse.vt.edu/ecp. The undergraduate program culminates with a two-semester team-oriented engineering design project in which the students address a significant problem in their area of special interest. MSE is unique within the College of Engineering in that they offer a more ambitious project for students enrolled in the University Honors program. The MSE students have pursued various minors including Microelectronics, Green Engineering, Chemistry, Mathematics, Music, a foreign language, and various others. The B.S. in MSE degree program at Virginia Tech is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org. Educational Enhancement Opportunities Students of MSE can optionally participate in the cooperative education program in which qualified students may alternate semesters of study with semesters of professional employment. (www.career.vt.edu/experience/ceip.html) Honors-eligible students may participate in a formalized program of study leading to one of several university honors degrees (see www.honorscollege.vt.edu). MSE traditionally graduates several students with thedegree \"Bachelor of Science in Materials Science and Engineering (in Honors)\", as well as some of the other Honors designations. Inquiries to MSE Advising are welcomed. There are several department guided programs for study abroad and cultural exchanges. The MSE department has established relationships with several universities offering strong MSE programs in other countries. Programs in which the student studies abroad for one or two semesters typically have a foreign language requirement. At this time, programs are available in China, France, Germany and Switzerland. Students with interest in said programs are strongly advised to have at least two years of high school experience with the appropriate language. Short-term (3 week) summer programs are available, which do not have a language requirement. Inquiries to MSE Advising are welcomed.

Jacobson Academic Advisor: Tammy Henderson Web: www.performingarts.vt.edu Overview The Virginia Tech Department of Music provides high-quality training to a select number of music majors, as well as ensembles and courses for large numbers of non-music majors. Instruction takes place in a handsome new facility which has superb rehearsal rooms, well-designed practice rooms and music teaching studios, a beautiful acoustically engineered Recital Salon, and laboratories with state-of-the-art electronic equipment for music study, recording, and digital music. The curriculum offers an excellent liberal arts education with a low professor/student ratio combined with the library, computer facilities, and cultural interaction which only a major comprehensive university can provide. Learning is enhanced by the use of music technology across the curriculum and innovativeprograms such as laboratory ensembles and extensive teaching experiences in the music education program. Together with traditional degree programs in Performance, Music Education, Technology and Composition, students may design a degree plan combining music with virtually all other majors offered by the university. Virginia Tech faculty artists and scholars have performed and lectured at conventions, in music festivals, and on concert series throughout the United States and in Canada, Europe, Asia, and South America. Each year, internationally known guest artists join forces with our faculty to perform world caliber performances on campus. Prospective music majors must successfully complete an audition/interview. Contact the chairperson of the Music Scholarship and Audition Committee, School of Performing Arts, 195 Alumni Mall (0141), Henderson Hall, Room 247, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061-0240 to receive information concerning auditions and scholarship opportunities. Scholarship support is available. Please also refer to the School of Performing Arts general information section for details. The major in music, leading to a B.A., emphasizes four areas of music: music education; performance; technology and composition as well as a designed option. This designed option area is provided as a means for a student to tailor music and non-music courses into a curriculum that best meets the interests of the student. In addition to fulfilling the Curriculum for Liberal Education and the core curriculum requirements of the College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences, the music major must pursue a concentration in one of the above areas of emphasis. There are eight primary options available to music majors. These are: 84-Credit Music Education Option (see website for details) 51-Credit Performance - Liberal Arts Option 78-Credit Performance - Professional Vocal Option 78-Credit Performance - Professional Instrumental Option 78-Credit Composition - Professional Option 52-Credit Music Technology - Liberal Arts Option 78-Credit Music Technology - Professional Option In addition, all music majors must meet a minimum level of piano proficiency no later than two semesters prior to graduation. Music majors are expected to participate in an ensemble or as an accompanist every semester of residence and attend a minimum number of concerts and recitals. Additional curriculum and policy information is available in the Handbook for Music Majors on the department website. There are three options available as a minor in music, including a general option, a music technology option and a jazz option. The minor in music consists of 18 semester hours selected from performance, history/literature, and theory/composition. Interested students should contact Tammy Henderson, Virginia Tech, 246 Henderson Hall, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061-0240 or at tammyh@vt.edu for the exact requirements. The department follows the Curriculum for Liberal Education except in Area 4 - Scientific Reasoning and Discovery, of which two credits of laboratory science are not required. Both the Department of Music and the university foreign language requirement are the same, except for vocal performance majors. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is atransition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Satisfactory Progress University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\") and toward the degree in music. Satisfactory progress requirements toward the B.A. in Music can be found on the major checksheet by visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.

Tao Web: www.ais.science.vt.edu/programs/Nanoscience.html Overview The Nanoscience (NANO) program is a joint effort of the departments of Biological Sciences, Chemistry, Geosciences, and Physics. It resides in, and is organized as a division of, the College of Science's Academy of Integrated Science. Nanoscience, the fundamental study of materials and structures whose size is on the nanometer scale, lies at the very foundation of our world. A nanometer is simply a billionth of a meter, and a typical atom is about 1/10th of a nanometer in size. At this length scale, atoms and molecules follow the laws of quantum physics, and the processes of life (for example, DNA and proteins are naturally-occurring nanoscale materials) and the properties of materials emerge from them. Due to a combination of profound theoretical insights, advances in scientific instrumentation, and massive computing power, we are now capable of imaging and steering single atoms with unprecedented precision, opening a window toward a world in which materials, chemical compounds, devices, and even small organisms can be built atom byatom and molecule by molecule, tailored toward desired properties and applications. At present, we are only at the dawn of this nanoscience revolution. Nanoscience courses prepare undergraduates for productive, exciting careers in emerging nanoscale industries. Degree recipients from this program will be ready to contribute to and lead cutting-edge corporate research and development in some of the most important and profitable industries in the world, including information technology, communications, drug development, imaging, and environmental technology. Bachelor of Science in Nanoscience A special brochure describing the division and the B.S. program in Nanoscience is available from the division's webpage or upon request.

Hansen Web: www.ppws.vt.edu Overview The primary mission of the department is research, extension and graduate education in the areas of plant pathology (nature, biology and control of plant diseases), plant physiology, and weed science (weed biology and control, action of herbicides). No undergraduate majors are offered in these areas, but the department does offer an undergraduate minor in Plant Health Sciences, focused on managing plant health in response to a variety of biotic and abiotic threats. These threats include pathogens, weeds, insects and environmental stressors (drought, heat, cold, pollutants, nutrients) that impact our food crops, forests, and landscape plants; students in the Departments of Crop and Soil Environmental Sciences, Horticulture, Biological Sciences, or Biochemistry are most likely to enroll in this minor, but students in other departments may participate as well if they have the prerequisite freshman biology and chemistry courses. Consult the department office (413 Price) or web site (www.ppws.vt.edu) for more informationon the minor. Several undergraduate courses offered by the department are also required or electives for students in agricultural or biological majors. These courses are designed to furnish basic knowledge of the nature, diagnosis, and control of plant diseases; identification, biology, and control of weeds; plant metabolism, nutrition, molecular biology, and growth regulation; invasive plant biology; and modern pest management and pesticide usage.

Thomas (231-2855) Web: www.psci.vt.eduOverview The department offers courses leading to degrees in Political Science and International Studies. These courses provide understanding of political systems, forms of government, international relations and other political processes throughout the world. Political science courses also offer preparation for careers in government, business, nonprofit/nongovernemnt organizations, law, politics, and education. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements. General Option for the B.A. Degree The general option encourages students to take courses in all of the subfields of political science, including political theory, comparative politics and government, U.S. politics and government, international relations, and research methodologies and methods. This permits students to describe, analyze, and evaluate governments, public policies, and political processes, systems, and behaviors, locally, nationally and globally. Students choosing this option pursue careers in government, nongovernmental organizations, business, education, law, policy analysis, and politics. Legal Studies Option for the B.A. Degree The Legal Studies option allows students to explore values, ideas, and reasoning linked to public law, its design, and its impact, preparing them for law school, graduate work in public policy fields, and a range of endeavors in and outside of governments. The option is not intended to be a pre-law program, although students hoping to attend law school may enroll for the option and may well benefit from its achievement. National Security Option for the B.A. Degree This option is intended to help students understand policy making in relation to the national security of the United States. Students are directed toward courses in foreign and military policy and the presidential and congressional branches of U.S. government. Political Thought Option for the B. A. Degree This option directs attention to courses in the department that focus upon political thought and to courses in other university departments that deal with ethical thought. This cross-disciplinary approach is designed to enable students to contextualize their study of political theory and ethics in a broad scholarly framework.Minors The requirements to earn a minor in Political Science or in National Security and Foreign Affairs can be found on the specific checksheets available on the University Registrar's website. Students majoring or minoring in Political Science or in International Studies may not complete the National Security and Foreign Affairs minor. Regarding Double Majors The Department of Political Science offers majors in both Political Science and International Studies. Courses for the majors overlap significantly. Therefore, students may not pursue a major in Political Science and a major in International Studies simultaneously, nor major in one and minor in the other. Advising The department provides advisors to help students understand and meet degree requirements. Career counseling also is available in the department, as is advising for students interested in attending graduate or law school after graduation from Virginia Tech. Internships The department arranges academic credit for internships in state, local, and federal governments, nonprofit organizations, and other appropriate settings. The department's internship program offers students a chance to gain career-related experience in a wide variety of organizations. Information on these opportunities can be obtained from the internship director. Student Organizations To provide opportunities for informal association of faculty and students, the department sponsors the Political Science Club; a chapter of Phi Alpha Delta, the pre-law honor society; a chapter of Pi Sigma Alpha, the national honor society in political science; and other student organizations such as Model United Nations. Information about these activities, as well as about any other aspect of the department, may be obtained from the department chair, advisors, or the department office. Satisfactory Progress University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimum criteria toward the Curriculum for Liberal Education (see Academics chapter in this catalog), toward the department's general education requirements, and toward the degree in Political Science. Satisfactory progress toward the B.A. in political science requires completion of PSCI 1014, 1024, and 2024 within the first 60 credit hours attempted. Students must also maintain an in-major GPA of 2.0 and must achieve a minimum grade of C in both PSCI 1014 and 1024. Study Abroad Virginia Tech offers a variety of study abroad programs.

The B.S. in Real Estate is a comprehensive, interdisciplinary academic program that draws classes from five colleges (College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Architecture and Urban Studies, Pamplin College of Business, College of Engineering, and College of Liberal Arts and Human Sciences) to students with dynamic education. The Program in Real Estate offers a Bachelor of Science degree in Real Estate. Real Estate courses integrate the material students learn in disciplinary courses such as finance, law, and property management through practical experiences within the academic program. The integration occurs though a university-industry partnership where real estate professionals are actively involved in students' education through guest lectures, mentoring experiences, and by providing internship opportunities. In addition to learning about the broad field of real estate, students are encouraged to find their niche in the field. Students develop an area of expertise to fulfill their restricted electives requirement. This is accomplished by adding a second major, completing a minor, or creating an area of concentration (with theapproval of their academic advisor) that meets each student's unique interests. Graduates of the Virginia Tech Program in Real Estate will be prepared to enter the Real Estate industry upon graduation and make immediate professional contributions. Plan of Study Note: Graduation requires a total of 120 semester credit hours. Requirements are subject to change; prospective students should contact their academic advisor prior to initiating their programs of study.

Britt, M. Gabriele, S. Johnson, and M. Saffle Associate Professors: A. Abeysekara, A. Ansell, Z. Ni, A. Puckett, E. Satterwhite, P. Schmitthenner, and R. Scott Assistant Professors: D. Christensen, S. Patel, and B. Singh Postdoctoral Fellow: M. Case Instructors: K. Dhillon, T. Edmondson, M. Goodrum, J. Hennen, and J. Laney Web: http://liberalarts.vt.edu/rlcl Overview The Department of Religion and Culture critically investigates religion, culture, and their relationships by problematizing what is commonly considered self-evident, especially since these subjects are intrinsic to understanding the human condition both locally and globally. In our research, teaching, and engagement, we seek to craft and apply new forms of critical inquiry that advance integrative intellectual thought. These paths of inquiry inform our engagement with students, who become well prepared to understand complextransformations throughout their lives, whether they pursue graduate studies or other life trajectories. The department offers an undergraduate degree in Religion and Culture (RLCL), including a degree option in Humanities for Publoc Service, and minors in American Studies, Appalachian Studies, Asian Area Studies, Judaic Studies, Medieval and Early Modern Studies, Middle East Studies, Popular Culture, and Religion. The department also offers an M.A. in Material Culture and Public Humanities, two graduate certificates--one in Religious Studies and the other in Material Culture and Public Humanities; and is a core member of the Alliance for Social, Political, Ethical, and Cultural Thought (ASPECT) Ph.D. program. Religion and Culture Major (RLCL) The Bachelor of Arts degree in Religion and Culture (RLCL) combines the strengths of the department in the areas of the humanities and study of religion in order to provide students with opportunities to examine several of the twenty-first century's most important global phenomena. Students completing this cutting-edge, one-of- a-kind degree will explore the impact of religious and cultural practices on politics, economics, the arts, and everyday life (including pop culture), as well as the impact of these practices on moral and ethical practices in today's world. Graduates will be prepared to contribute as employees and citizens to the state of Virginia, the United States, and indeed the world as all levels of society seek better ways to live and work together in the increasingly diverse contexts of the twenty-first century. Religion and culture shape the world and will continue to do so in dramatic and changing ways. Students in the major option, Humanities for Public Service, build a strong foundation in humanistic learning about cultural and religious traditions with the aim of preparing for careers in public service. The major option cultivates cultural awareness and critical thinking skills, familiarizing students with the ways that people have conceptualized, encoded, and reflected on human experience. Therefore it prepares them to sensitively and thoughtfully work for the public good. Students who choose this major will develop complex problem-solving skills, alongside critical thinking that will prepare them for a wide range of careers. The global focus of the major affords career opportunities in education, business, government, many private industries, and the non-profit sector. The major has a strong academic and career-advising component. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply.

Jones (Psychology), L. Roy (English), T. Sato (School of Education), B. Shadle (History), P. Wallenstein (History), and V. White (School of Visual Arts) Africana Studies is an interdisciplinary field of study that uses concepts and methodologies of the Social Sciences and the Humanities, centering on the study of peoples of African descent. The program cooperates with faculty from across the university, whose teaching and research is concerned with Africa and the African diaspora. Africana Studies engages with other programs and organizations in community awareness activities that celebrate the richness and diversity of African diasporic cultures and traditions. An Africana Studies minor is open to all students who are interested in learning about the experiences of Africans and people of African descent. American Indian Studies: A Holistic Approach Director: Samuel R. Cook Associate Professor: S. Cook Assistant Professor: N. Copeland A program in the Department of Sociology, we offer several courses and a minor in American Indian Studies. We believe that any successful American Indian Studies program must do more than simply educate a general student body on American Indian cultures and issues in a sensitive way. We believe that our curricula must exist in conjunction with all university programs pertinent to American Indians, and must depend on the impetus of indigenous peoples working within and beyond the university. In keeping with Virginia Tech's status and mission as a land grant institution, we strive to serve our indigenous constituency, both as educators and as partners. Accordingly, our program serves as a vital conduit for university-tribal relations, the recruitment and retention of American Indian students and faculty, and Service-Learning initiatives in indigenous communities. Although our program has a regional focus, we offer a wide spectrum of courses--ranging from American Indian Literatures, American Indian Spirituality, and American Indian Arts, to native Peoples of the Southeast, American Indians in Film, and Global indigenous Rights--reflecting the impressive and diverse expertise of our faculty. In short, we embrace a holistic, collaborative approach to American Indian Studies in which university faculty and students develop and maintain meaningful partnerships. Accordingly, we maintain a tribaladvisory board consisting of elders and leaders from all of Virginia's eight Indian Nations. We regard these representatives, and ultimately, all indigenous peoples as our colleagues. Women's and Gender Studies Program Director: Sharon P. Johnson Professors: N. M.

The Women's and Gender Studies Program is housed in the Department of Sociology and includes teaching faculty and affiliates from across the entire campus. WGS affiliated faculty contribute to the program through their research, student advising, participation in governance, and teaching. Women's and Gender Studies 1824 is a pathways course. Our program also offers courses for all students in the university, including four in Area 2 of the Curriculum for Liberal Education (WGS 1824, WGS 2224, WGS 2244, and WGS 2254), one in Area 3 (WGS 2264), and one in Area 7 (WGS 3214). Students interested in WGS may select from two minors, Women's and Gender Studies, and Gender, Science, and Technology. The degree option and minors are interdisciplinary, cross-cultural programs of study in which students cultivate an understanding of the complex ways that gender is defined and contested in social structures, history, culture, and technology. They offer students new ways of thinking about how gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexuality shape social institutions and cultural beliefs as well as personal experiences and perceptions. Central to the mission of the Women's and Gender Studies Program is the empowerment of a diverse population of women within local, regional, national, and global contexts. Students interested in learning more about the Women's & Gender Studies program should contact theprogram director, Sharon Johnson at spjohnso@vt.edu A graduate certificate in Women's and Gender Studies is also available. See the Graduate Catalog. Center For Peace Studies and Violence Prevention Director: James Hawdon The Center for Peace Studies and Violence Prevention is a student-center, multi-disciplinary undertaking to promote research, education and outreach in the area of peace studies and violence prevention. Since its inception in 2008, the Center has adopted three thematic areas: The prevention of violence Peace studies The development of new leaders for this century The Center is a hub for research and pedagogy on peace studies and violence prevention. Our multidisciplinary approach allows students, faculty, and a variety of off-campus constituents to address peace building and violence prevention in a holistic manner. The Center for Peace Studies offers a minor in Peace Studies. The minor is designed to provide students with a broad perspective on violence prevention and peace building. Students minoring in Peace Studies will be required to take two core courses, Peace and Violence as Critical Incidents (PSVP 2044) and Global Society, Violence and the Prospects for Peace (PSVP 4104). In addition, students will select four elective courses from a variety of courses that focus on either \"local\" issues of violence prevention and peace building or \"global\" issues of violence prevention and peace building. Center for Race & Social Policy Director: Wornie Reed The Center for Race and Social Policy (RSP), presently a College Center, was formed in April 2001 as a University Center to fulfill two primary goals: (1) to conduct and disseminate original research in the area of public policy with a direct emphasis on race and ethnicity; and (2) to prepare promising graduate students to think and speak critically, plan quality research, and contribute to public-policy discussions related to race and ethnicity. The Center promotes a broad and inclusive concept of race and ethnicity, which includes African Americans, American Indians, Asian Americans, European Americans, Latinos, and bi-racial and multi- racial identities. RSP research projects involve the development and evaluation of public policy across different racial and ethnic contexts and within myriad public policy venues, including welfare, employment, education, and health as well as community outreach.

Standley Web: www.sova.vt.edu OverviewThe School of Visual Arts (SOVA) offers studio-based programs in the visual arts balanced with the study of the history, theory, and criticism of visual and material culture. The faculty includes both practicing artists and scholars of art history. The School emphasizes new digital media as well as traditional artistic media. We offer B.F.A. degrees in both Visual Communication Design and Studio Arts, as well as a B.A. degree and minor in Art History. SOVA provides a variety of exhibitions and art events. The Armory Art Gallery exhibits work by national and regional artists. XYZ, a student-run gallery, provides students and regional artists the opportunity to create and show wide-ranging experimental work. The Collaboration for Creative Technologies in Arts and Design (CCTAD) is a cross-disciplinary initiative with Art, Music, Computer Science and Communications. The Digital Arts and Animation Studio (DAAS) is designed to facilitate this new concentration. FourDesign, a University Service Center, provides outstanding seniors with a vital professional design experience. Student interns work in a team environment under the direction of FourDesign faculty to produce design work for clients, providing professional and entrepreneurial experience rarely available to undergraduates. Through visiting artists and scholars, the School also brings students and members of the art community into dialogue with artists and critics of international prominence. SOVA participates in the University's Education Abroad Program, which is open to students at the sophomore level or above, and combines classroom study with travel-study tours in Europe, Cuba, and Latin America. Foundations of Art and Design is a year-long, entry-level intensive program that prepares students for advanced study in the visual fields of Integrative Studio Art and Visual Communications Design.

            "Values": "Overview B.A. in Public and Urban Affairs B.S. in Environmental Policy and Planning Degree Requirements Satisfactory Progress Undergraduate Course Descriptions (UAP) Co-Chair: Tom Sanchez University Distinguished Professor: P. Knox Professors: J.O. Browder, S. Hirt, T. Sanchez, and M. Stephenson Associate Professors: D. Bieri, R. Buehler, R. Hall, K. Wernstedt, D. Zahm, and Y. Zhang Assistant Professors: M. Cowell, S. Misra, T. Schenk, and T. Skuzinski Adjunct Professors: B. Anderson, S. Mastran, E. Morton, J. Provo, and M. E. Ridenour Web: www.uap.vt.edu Overview The Urban Affairs and Planning Program (UAP) offers two undergraduate degrees, the B.A. in public and urban affairs and the B.S. in environmental policy and planning, as well as minors under both degrees. At the graduate level the department offers the master of urban and regional planning degree. B.A. in Public and Urban Affairs The B.A. in public and urban affairs (PUA) is an interdisciplinary social science degree with a professional cast. It aims to educate students in the liberal arts tradition while equipping them with the skills,knowledge, and analytical thinking used in planning and policy. Students learn to address the political, economic, environmental, social, and governmental consequences of growth and change and to help resolve the problems that emanate from them. B.S. in Environmental Policy and Planning The B.S. in environmental policy and planning (EPP) provides students the opportunity to study environmental problems and their solutions from an interdisciplinary perspective involving humanities, natural and social science, planning, and public policy. While rooted in scientific and technological fields, environmental problems and their solutions increasingly deal with public values, economics, law, policy, and planning. The EPP curriculum, while providing a broad liberal arts and natural and social science base, has a pre-professional slant involving analytical and communication skills and policy and planning methods to prepare students for employment and graduate study. Degree Requirements The graduation requirements in effect at the time of graduation apply. When choosing the degree requirements information, always choose the year of your expected date of graduation. Requirements for graduation are referred to via university publications as \"Checksheets\". The number of credit hours required for degree completion varies among curricula. Students must satisfactorily complete all requirements and university obligations for degree completion. The university reserves the right to modify requirements in a degree program. However, the university will not alter degree requirements less than two years from the expected graduation year unless there is a transition plan for students already in the degree program. Please visit the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi- brief/index1.html for degree requirements. Satisfactory Progress University policy requires that students who are making satisfactory progress toward a degree meet minimum criteria toward the General Education (Curriculum for Liberal Education) (see \"Academics\") and toward the degree in Urban Affairs and Planning. Satisfactory progress requirements toward the B.A. in Public and Urban Affairs and B.S. in Environmental Policy and Planning can be found on the major checksheet by visiting the University Registrar website at http://registrar.vt.edu/graduation-multi-brief/index1.html.
